Milliken Gallery, December 1982\nThe David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base is a project of the\nArtist Archives Initiative\nat New York University. As an information resource, it is intended to aid curators, conservators, and others who are researching the work of David Wojnarowicz. It contains information that we believe will be helpful for future exhibitions, conservation interventions, and writing about his work. Much of this information is drawn from the David Wojnarowicz Papers in the Downtown Collection of artist papers located in the Fales Library at New York University.\nDig in and send us your feedback. This is an ongoing project that we hope to build out over time. We encourage contributions from other researchers who find this resource helpful and would like to add to it. Please see our\nHow to Contribute\npage to submit content to the Knowledge Base or send questions to the Knowledge Base Manager.\nPlease visit the\nArtist Archives Initiative website\nto learn more about the larger aims of our work, then come back to learn more about this pivotal late twentieth century artist/activist. As we move forward with expanding the website, conducting symposia, and encouraging publication, we aim to advance discussion on broader issues underlying the curation and conservation of contemporary art, including concerns about authorship, authenticity, and ethical responsibilities of professional actors.\nThe David Wojanrowicz Knowledge Base was originally developed on the MediaWiki platform and rendered in the current static format in June 2020.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=4388\n\"\nCategory\n:\nAbout Pages\nThis page was last modified on 5 January 2018, at 10:52.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nMain page\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

Our aim is to continue to add content and modify the structure as more researchers find the site and see value in contributing to it. If you are a student, professor, or independent researcher and would like to develop new content for the Knowledge Base, we welcome your contributions. We have developed a short list of possible projects, which are listed below, but we are also open to suggestions.\nLocation Research\n- Many locations feature prominently in Wojnarowicz's artwork and biographical history, and we would welcome further explorations into these spaces. In particular, we are interested in projects that examine the East Village, NYC; Paris, France; Mexico City, Mexico; New Jersey; and Normal, Illinois. We are also interested in research looking at specific locations and their relevance to Wojnarowicz, such as the Ward Line Pier or various galleries in which he exhibited.\nCase Studies on Individual Works\n- Wojnarowicz's work is densely layered with meaning, imagery, and text, and careful analyses of individual pieces of his art offer fascinating insight into his process, thinking, life, and vision. We have developed a few on this site already, including ones on\nThe Magic Box\n,\nOne Day This Kid\n, and\nA Fire In My Belly\n. We are open to case studies on any of his works, but are particularly interested in the Flower Series, the Sex Series, Science Lesson, and Rimbaud in New York.\nInterviews\n- We have developed\nan archive of interviews\nwith Wojnarowicz's collaborators, gallerists, and friends; however, we are always looking to expand out holdings. We have a list of people we are particularly interested in having interviewed, but we are also open to suggestions of other individuals.\nProfiles of Other Archives\n- While the Fales Library and Special Collections holds Wojnarowicz's papers, there are also other significant collections of his work and ephemera. We are looking to build out the descriptions of these collections. A short list of some of the collections we are interested in is contained in our\nlist of external resources\n.\nIf you would like to take on one of these projects, or if you have another idea in mind, please contact the David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base Manager at\nfales.wojnarowicz@nyu.edu\n.

Launched in 2017, it will continue to grow as new researchers make contributions in the future. We describe the submission process on the\nHow to Contribute\npage.\nAs explained on our\nHow to Use This Site\npage, there are multiple ways to navigate the resource. Researchers can use the left sidebar menu, move around by clicking on our embedded hyperlinks, search by topic or keyword in the search field, use the “What Links Here” feature to call up related pages, or click on a category to see groups of pages. We developed this multi-layered search system because of the challenges we encountered in developing the hierarchical menu that you see on the left-hand side of the screen. We describe these challenges on the\nThe Database Challenge\npage.\nAfter considerable research, the project team selected MediaWiki software as a platform for this resource. This is the same software used by Wikipedia, although we use it differently. We discuss the technical research and our commitment to open source software on the\nTechnical Summary\npage. The inspiration for this resource came from those of us who love the work of David Wojnarowicz, those of us who are concerned about conserving the art of our times for future generations, and those of us who like a good database design challenge. A primary resource for our research was the\nWojnarowicz Papers\nin the\nFales Library Downtown Collection\nat NYU. We also read widely about his life and his work in published resources and on various resources online.\nIn addition to gathering pre-existing information, we interviewed a number of people who knew and worked with Wojnarowicz. Audio files and transcripts of the interviews are on our\nInterviews\npage. Included in the resource is information about his\nWorks\n, a\nSelected Bibliography\n, a directory of\nPeople\nwith whom he worked, and information about selected\nExhibitions\nof his work.\nKnowing that users of this resource will include serious professionals and scholars, we strove to cite all of our sources and communicate ambiguities and conflicting information when we found it. We will plan to stay abreast of new resources and of old links that no longer function. Please help us by letting us know about new publications, new online resources, and broken links.

Francisco Chaparro. September 2015.\nResearchers involved in the development of this resource were challenged by the nature of David Wojnarowicz’ life and art.  His works often do not fit into typical art historical classifications of medium and style, nor do they fit into standard archival descriptions. As depicted in the diagram on the left designed by project researcher Francisco Chaparro, there is a complex web of relationships between David Wojnarowicz, his artworks, people he knew and worked with, places associated with him and his art, texts related to his work, and external resources that may be helpful to users of this knowledge base. This recognition drove us away from designing a hierarchical database towards a wiki platform that affords multiple linkages within the resource, promoting a deeper understanding of these relationships.\nTo illustrate these complex relationships, Wojnarowicz used the same images, objects and references in multiple contexts, allowing them to develop multiple meanings and functions.  One example of an object that was presented in multiple contexts is a life-sized shark that he covered with maps and exhibited as a component of his\nBurning Child\ninstallation\nat the\nGracie Mansion Gallery\nin 1984. The shark was also shown as a hanging sculpture apart from the installation in addition to appearing in photographs. It exists in his personal papers as both an independent artwork and an element of another artwork.\nThe Magic Box\n, depicted below on the right, is another example. It contains sixty-nine objects collected by Wojnarowicz, including plastic toys, jewelry, stones, feathers, seeds, and photographs.  The Magic Box disrupts archival and art historical concepts of classification, provenance, context and description since specific functions of the box and its contents are not known. Yet the combination of objects holds complex symbolic and material values that shed light on Wojnarowicz’ life and art.  Some objects were integrated into his art production and appear in his photographs and films; others were not. To make these links discoverable, should we identify the\nMagic Box\nand/or its components as artworks? Should we link them to multiple artworks on the wiki?\nMagic Box (n.d.). Courtesy of the artist and Galerie Buchholz, New York.\nAnother example of complex associations of Wojnarowicz’ objects that complicated our wiki design can be found in his\nstencils\n. They were used to produce graffiti, paintings, site-specific installations, and prints. Some of the stencils are associated with artworks at multiple locations over time, involving different people. In addition, many of the stencils are in poor condition, composed of ephemeral media, and in need of thorough research prior to conservation, exhibition, or publication. They are heavily soiled, torn, and evidence signs of use, all of which is considered integral to their history. Should conservators clean and repair them, or should the soiling and signs of deterioration be left to witness their history of use? How should we represent multiple viewpoints on the wiki?\nOne more example can be found in the Super 8 film fragments in the\nDowntown Collection of the Fales Library\nat New York University Fales. Some were spliced together in various combinations to make multiple films, as in the four versions of the “Mexico” films analyzed by project researcher Regina Harsanyi. Some of these fragments were never used, although Wojnarowicz intended to use them as evidenced by the storyboards in his notebooks. Various people were involved with the films, sometimes as actors, co-authors, producers, directors, camera operators, and editors. Often people played multiple roles, including as artists who featured Wojnarowicz in their own films or who were associated with his other works and exhibitions.\nIn addition to the complications of classifications, meanings, and associations, many of Wojnarowicz’ works, particularly his films and videos, were not completed during his life. Exhibiting an incomplete or posthumously assembled work has the problematic potential of misrepresenting his original intent. The current attention Wojnarowicz receives and the controversies surrounding the posthumous assemblage of his moving image and audio fragments make this research critical to scholars and professionals in the art world. Issues of appropriate conservation and exhibition practices, in addition to questions of authorship, authenticity, and artwork integrity that arise from Wojnarowicz’ work are relevant to many contemporary artists who employ ephemeral media, use conceptual strategies and create media installations.\nIn developing this resource, project researchers needed to distinguish fact from fiction, or at least to recognize a certain fluidity, since Wojnarowicz’ writings, and those of others,\nand\nour interviews all contain conflicting statements. For example, he wrote in his notebooks about real and fictional characters that need to be distinguished in the database. He and others gave contradictory details of his life, his art, and past exhibitions. We provide citations for our sources, and accept contradictions where they exist. In the future we plan to host multiple timelines of his life that illustrate contradictions in accounts of his biography to researchers.

After some experimentation by the computer science team, it became clear that a traditional Collections Management System such as The Museum System\n[1]\nor  Omeka\n[2]\nwould not suffice to meet the challenges in this field of contemporary art\n(see the “Wojnarowicz Challenge” page)\n. We considered customizing an open source content management system (CMS) using an open source framework such as Drupal\n[3]\nbut that would have required considerable custom programming leading to both higher development costs and higher future maintenance costs. We selected a wiki for our Knowledge Base to insure a stable and high-performance web environment . In addition, we selected  MediaWiki software\n[4]\nin order to leverage both the category/subcategory functionality provided natively by the wiki software to group web pages in meaningful ways; as well as the powerful page/section structure to create meaningful URLs for linking within and across pages.\nOur Commitment to Open-Source Software\nWe are committed to open source software for this project for many reasons. As scholars, we believe that our contribution to the study of contemporary art and artists should be completely transparent, including the software that we have built. We are mindful of the budget constraints for many arts and archival institutions . We have designed and built our project using readily available open source and free software so that others may learn from our experience and emulate any and all aspects of our work as they wish.\nTechnical Infrastructure and Components of this Project\nThe Artist Archives - David Wojnarowicz project uses two wikis and one WordPress site to meet the needs of our scholars, researchers, students, and users. The project portal is based on a WordPress site initially developed in WordPress\n[5]\nversion 4.5  using a child theme based on\nEditor\n[6]\n. The purpose of the WordPress site is to provide a visually enticing and clean opening to serve as a\nProject Website\nto all of our current and future artist sites.  We selected WordPress for the Project Website as it is open source; it can be developed by graduate students in the Humanities and the Arts as it does not require extensive technical training; it has a strong user base; and we anticipate minimal systems maintenance needs going forward, thus ensuring that our preservation goals are met.\nWe have also installed two wiki’s as part of this project: the Knowledge Base and the Archivist Administration wiki. We initially installed MediaWiki software\n[7]\nversion 1.26.2 for several reasons from a technical standpoint. MediaWiki is the software used for the popular Wikipedia\n[8]\nand related sites so we anticipate a shallow learning curve for our users. This platform has a large and growing user-base so we anticipate minimal systems maintenance needs and we believe this platform meets our preservation goals for this site. We strive to configure the wikis as needed rather than using custom programming in order to further support our preservation goals and to minimize both our development and our long-term system maintenance costs and needs. Both wiki's use the Metrolook skin\n[9]\nwhich is derivative (fork) of the Vector skin and uses responsive design.\nThe two wiki’s are as follows.\nThe Knowledge Base wiki contains the reports and information about our artist, in this case, David Wojnarowicz.  Note that we are using the Knowledge Base wiki to present research and findings; we do not provide the typical wiki options for users to sign in and add their own information. All non-members to the Knowledge Base have read-only access. Contributions to the site are welcome; instructions are posted here [hyperlink] and users are requested to send their scholarly contributions by email  [email address] to our archivists and scholars who review the material before posting it to the Knowledge Base.\nThe Archivists’ wiki contains training pages for our scholars, students and staff; sample pages for each member of the team to use as they learn wiki markup; and notes on administration and management such as workflow, media file specifications, and other information required for the scholars, students and staff. We plan to continue to engage graduate students from a variety of fields (art history, museum studies and other related areas of study) in this project alongside the archivists at Fales Special Collections\n[10]\nand therefore we anticipate training additional students and scholars each year. We plan to encourage this “turn over” so that our project will meet our pedagogical goals along with our scholarly goals. Scholars and students who are new to wiki markup thus have a “sandbox” in which to experiment and learn without concern about disrupting the production environment. This is a self-documenting project as we encourage scholars, students and staff to update and add to the training manuals and user documentation on an ongoing basis in order to share what they learn with others.\nMedia Specifications\nThe audio files (e.g. interviews with friends and colleagues of the artist) are recorded in archival format files and posted to the Knowledge Base as .mp3 files. The software uses the MediaWiki extension Html5Mediator\n[11]\nfor streaming the .mp3 files. Still images are posted as low-resolution .jpegs. Videos are hosted by Fales and accessed through the Knowledge Base as external URLs for streaming directly from the Fales Wojnarowicz Finding Aid\n[12]\n.\nOur Commitment to Pedagogy: Training the Next Generation of Art History Scholars, Curators, Archivists and Systems Staff\nThis project meets many pedagogical goals. A current list of student participants is posted\nhere\n. Students have participated in this project through a variety of courses; internships; and independent study projects. To date we have worked with graduate students from Museum Studies\n[13]\n, the Institute of Fine Arts\n[14]\n, Media Culture and Communications\n[15]\n,  Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP)\n[16]\nand\nLearning From Artists' Archives\nat the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill\n[17]\n; and undergraduate students in Computer Science\n[18]\n. The graduate students have been given access to add and edit scholarly content in the WordPress and wiki sites. The Computer Science students have been given access to work directly on the web and database servers to participate in the installation, implementation, and configuration as the project has progressed; as well as to provide assistance by building software tools to assist with data migration and other tasks.\nGlossary of Terms\nArticle\nA wiki webpage on a unified topic.\nContent Management System (CMS)\nA CMS provides a user interface for adding and updating data in a database without the direct intervention of a webmaster. MediaWiki\n[19]\nis configured using PHP along with either MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite as the underlying database.\nCSS (Cascading Stylesheets)\nCSS\n[20]\nis a stylesheet language widely used on the web to format the presentation of the page contents.\nDirected Graph\nA directed graph\n[21]\nis an abstract concept to help one visualize the relationships among entities; in the case of MediaWiki, one could visualize the relationships among the categories as a directed graph (as opposed to a strictly hierarchical design).\nExtension\nExtensions\n[22]\nare software programs that allow one to customize MediaWiki and add functionality.

His omnivorous approach to materials and techniques presents challenges to traditional art historical divisions between media.\nHere, we have divided works according to traditional categories in order to promote media-specific research. However, because of Wojnarowicz's tendency to use multiple techniques and varied materials in a single work, the media descriptions are densely interconnected with hyperlinked references. (For example, paintings relate to photography, sculpture to film, and vice versa, and these are reflected by hyperlinks between pages.) This porosity between categories represents Wojnarowicz's non-hierarchical approach to traditional art-making categories, and his willingness to use what was at hand to achieve his desired effect. When asked about his tendency to collage different media together, Wojnarowicz responded: “I was breaking down barriers, whether of time, or history, or spaces of delineations, of occurrences. It’s all energies. So you start making these borders disappear, spaces disappear or fuse. They are all connected anyway, making what we project as borders invisible.”\n[1]\nAs scholars continue to use this site we invite further additions to these pages.\nArchival Material from\nWojnarowicz Papers\n, Fales Library\nThese pages from the Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library demonstrate the range of media that Wojnarowicz employed to create his work. A monthly budget from c. 1990 (above left) reveals that Wojnarowicz was spending as much on photostats as he was on canvas and paint, for example. The installation sketch on the right illustrates the range the media that Wojnarowicz would bring together for a single work, showing that the diverse approaches in his practice were not mutually exclusive enterprises, but rather were various means of expression that could be used individually or together to achieve Wojnarowicz's desired message.\nSubcategories\nThis category has the following 8 subcategories, out of 8 total.\nF\nFilm and Video\nI\nInstallation\nP\nPainting\nPerformance\nPhotography\nS\nSculpture\nT\nText\nW\nWorks on Paper\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Category:Mediums&oldid=4380\n\"\nCategory\n:\nWorks\nThis page was last modified on 16 December 2017, at 11:05.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nCategory\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

Photostat mounted on board, 30 x 41 inches. Edition of 10. Courtesy of the Estate of David Wojnarowicz and PPOW, New York\nDavid Michael Wojnarowicz was a gay artist, writer, and activist, whose multimedia work was deeply concerned with issues of social justice, queerness, sex, poverty, AIDS, and many of the other pressing issues of his day. He was closely associated with the art movement that developed in New York City’s Lower East Side during the 1980s.\nWojnarowicz was born on September 14, 1954 in Red Bank, New Jersey, the youngest of three siblings. His childhood was marked by both neglect and abuse, particularly on the part of his father, who was an alcoholic who would commit suicide in 1976 when Wojnarowicz was twenty-two.\nWhen their parents divorced in 1956, Wojnarowicz’s mother Delores received custody of Wojnarowicz and his siblings, however, their father abducted them to Michigan for a year and maintained custody of them until they moved in with their mother in New York City, some time between 1963-1965. Poorly supervised and accustomed to spending long afternoons in the suburban woods by himself, Wojnarowicz wandered the city, drawn to its seediest parts. Sometime around the age of twelve, he had his first experience with an older man offering him money for sex, although he probably didn’t start hustling regularly until he was fifteen (this date is difficult to determine, as Wojnarowicz frequently altered his biography as he told it, both consciously and unconsciously).\nStarting at fourteen, Wojnarowicz attended the prestigious High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, although he never graduated. Soon after he turned seventeen, Wojnarowicz left his mother’s apartment and began living on the streets, which he did for the next two years. Eventually, he moved into a halfway house and finished his high school diploma in 1973 at the age of nineteen. He got a job at the original Pottery Barn and began writing poetry and creating ‘zines, his earliest “adult” forays into art making.\nFor the next few years, Wojnarowicz lived in New York City and traveled frequently, often by hopping trains or hitchhiking. He stayed briefly in San Francisco, as well as in France (with his sister Pat), before eventually returning to New York, where he worked as a busboy at the famous club Danceteria (where Keith Haring also worked). He formed a band called (\n3 Teens Kill 4\n), in which he played children's toys and tape recordings of found sounds. He also documented life in the gritty Lower East Side, where he was particularly interested in marginal characters who seemed to live outside of the “preinvented world,” which was his term for all of the societal structures (like language and law) that we are born into and which exert control over us. He collected the stories of these \"outlaws\" in his first published book, 1982’s\nSounds in the Distance.\nAs the eighties wore on, Wojnarowicz became known in the East Village art scene for creating controversial and audacious installations and paintings, often using found objects, religious iconography, and explicit sexual imagery. Along with other experimental gay artists, he claimed the abandoned Ward Line Pier on Manhattan’s West Side as a sexual and artistic playground. He traveled frequently to the Southwest and to Mexico, where he identified with the same kind of outcasts he had met in the Lower East Side. In 1985, his work was included in the influential Whitney Biennial (the so-called “Graffiti Show”), which brought his name to a wider audience.\nDuring this time, Wojnarowicz came under the wing of photographer\nPeter Hujar\n, who would be his mentor and close friend until Hujar’s death from AIDS complications in 1987. Hujar’s death, and Wojnarowicz’s own seroconversion in 1986, transformed AIDS from an occasional subject of his work to a near constant theme, and he is best remembered today for his AIDS-related work.\nAs a political artist working on controversial topics, Wojnarowicz received frequent criticism and his work was often attacked as obscene.  In 1989, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) revoked funding for a show organized by Nan Goldin, because of an essay entitled “Post Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell,” which Wojnarowicz had written for the exhibition catalog. In 1990, the conservative American Family Association illegally copied and distributed images from Wojnarowicz’s work as part of a fundraiser / attack on the NEA. Although Wojnarowicz successfully sued them for copyright infringement, he was awarded only $1 in damages.\nIn the early 1990s, Wojnarowicz completed two more books – the autobiographical\nClose to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration\nin 1991, and the art book\nMemories that Smell Like Gasoline\nin 1992. Although he suffered greatly from both AIDS and poverty, he continued to produce work until his death from AIDS complications in 1992.\nAlthough he was only 37 when he died, Wojnarowicz left behind a large and complex body of work that defies easy categorization. Some of his most recognizable and critically well-received works include the Photostat\nOne Day This Kid...\n, the photograph\nUntitled (Buffalos)\n(which was used for the cover of U2's 1989 single release of their song \"One\" as a fundraiser for AIDS organizations), the painting\nScience Lesson\n(which was included in the 1985 Whitney Biennial), the performance installation\nIn the Shadow of Forward Motion\n. the film\nA Fire in My Belly\n, and\nthe \"Four Elements\" series of paintings\n.\nSources:\nCarr, Cythnia.\nFire in the Belly\n, 2012\n\"David Michael Wojnarowicz.\"The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Volume 3: 1991-1993.

Under\nCase Studies\nyou will find detailed information about a small selection of works by Wojnarowicz, and under\nMediums\nyou will find information about the wide range of materials and techniques he used.\nThroughout these pages you will find information related to Wojnarowicz's finished work, as well objects and activities that fall outside of the definition of finished work. In this way, these pages do not function as a typical object database, but rather seek to gather information relevant to Wojnarowicz's working processes, without privileging the finished object.\nSubcategories\nThis category has only the following subcategory.\nC\nCase Studies\nPages in category \"Works\"\nThe following 19 pages are in this category, out of 19 total.\nI\nInstallation--Action Installations\nInstallation--Multimedia Installations\nInstallation--Site-specific Paintings\nP\nPainting--Paint and Mixed Media on Canvas, Wood, and Masonite\nPainting--Paint and Mixed Media on Found Materials\nPainting--Paint and Mixed Media on Gelatin Silver Prints\nPerformance--3 Teens Kill 4\nPerformance--Lectures and Readings\nPerformance--Multimedia Performance\nPhotography--Chromogenic Prints and Gelatin Silver Prints\nPhotography--Photo-Text Collages\nPhotography--Photomontage\nS\nSculpture--Exhibited Sculpture\nSculpture--Other Objects\nSculpture--Props\nT\nText--Journals\nW\nWorks on Paper--Drawings\nWorks on Paper--Stencils\nWorks on Paper--Xeroxes\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Category:Works&oldid=3845\n\"\nThis page was last modified on 25 March 2017, at 18:11.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nCategory\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

Each case addresses a single work in depth, tracing its production and reception along with its connections to other works and collaborators. Wojnarowicz's work is very rarely bounded in a single object; these pages demonstrate that any given work is the accumulation of relationships between people, locations, experiences and objects. Extensive hyperlinks throughout these pages connect to resources throughout this site.\nThese case studies draw on research in the David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library and elsewhere.

This range of perspectives on the work preserves differing accounts of Wojnarowicz and his work. Among those that knew him personally, many recounted that Wojnarowicz tended to keep his relationships separate from one another, and would reveal different parts of himself depending on the relationship. Those that encountered his work professionally (ex. curators, gallerists, and conservators) similarly offered different views on Wojnarowicz's art and its display and preservation. These interviews were conducted by project directors\nMarvin Taylor\nand Glenn Wharton, along with other project staff.\nAnother goal of these interviews is to elucidate details of Wojnarowicz's media, techniques, and equipment in order to aid in the future conservation of his work. While some of these details are shared through interviews, and can be found throughout the medium-specific pages on this site, many interviewees relayed that Wojnarowicz simply did not discuss his artistic process in these terms.\nAperture\neditor\nMelissa Harris\nnoted \"It’s much more likely that we would have talked about something that had to do with politics or censorship or AIDS than it is that we would have talked about his process,\" and others echoed this statement. While Wojnarowicz clearly experimented relentlessly with different media, created meticulous work, and made detailed plans and sketches for the realization of the mental images he sought to render in physical form, a common refrain throughout the interviews was that Wojnarowicz valued the communication of the message above any engagement with particular media.\nPages in category \"Interviews\"\nThe following 11 pages are in this category, out of 11 total.\nI\nInterview with David Kiehl by Diana Kamin and Marvin Taylor on 8-10-2016\nInterview with Gary Schneider by Diana Kamin and Marvin Taylor on 8-2-2016\nInterview with Laura McCann by Glenn Wharton on 12-08-2016\nInterview with Marion Scemama by Glenn Wharton and Marvin Taylor on 11-3-2015\nInterview with Melissa Harris by Diana Kamin and Marvin Taylor on 8-22-2016\nInterview with Richard Kern by Diana Kamin and Marvin Taylor on 8-30-2016\nInterview with Robert Ransick by Diana Kamin and Glenn Wharton on 8-30-2016\nInterview with Sur Rodney Sur by Diana Kamin and Glenn Wharton on 9-8-2016\nInterview with Tommy Turner by Glenn Wharton and Marvin Taylor on 5-20-2016\nInterview with Van Cook and Romberger by Glenn Wharton and Marvin Taylor on 5-11-2016\nInterview with Wendy Olsoff by Diana Kamin on 7-9-2016\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Category:Interviews&oldid=3823\n\"\nThis page was last modified on 24 March 2017, at 12:37.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nCategory\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

He made super-8 films, created the photographic series \"Arthur Rimbaud in New York\", performed in the band Three Teens Kill 4 - No Motive, and exhibited his work in well known East Village galleries. In 1985, he was included in the Whitney Biennial, the so-called \"Graffiti Show\". He died of AIDS on July 22, 1992. The David Wojnarowicz Papers includes journals, correspondence, manuscripts, photography, film, video and audio works, source and production materials, objects, and ephemera.

Courtesy of the artist and Galerie Buchholz, New York.\nThe Magic Box is a unique collection of items that confounds traditional archival or art historical description. It consists of a small box holding 58 unique found items that Wojnarowicz kept under his bed at the time of his death, with a masking taped title affixed to the lid: “Magic Box.” The items include dried flowers, a group of tweezers and nail clippers, a bag of seeds, a single feather in tissue, a Buddha sculpture, a prayer card, a  toy grasshopper, and other disparate objects. According to\nCynthia Carr\n, who exhaustively researched Wojnarowicz and interviewed his extended network of friends, family, and lovers, Wojnarowicz never mentioned the Magic Box to friends or write about its significance. She found only one mention of its existence, in a 1988 journal entry that reads “Put Magic Box in installation.”\n[1]\nHe never did exhibit the items in the box. When the Fales Library & Special Collections acquired the Wojnarowicz Papers, the decision was made to keep the items together, catalogued simply under the series \"magic box\", with item level descriptions. This series was a priority to document digitally in order to minimize access and photographs can be found on the\nFales finding aid\n.\nContents\n1\nConservation and Display\n2\nImages from The David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library & Special Collections\n3\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\n4\nReferences\nConservation and Display\nThough never exhibited by Wojnarowicz, “Magic Box” has its own exhibition history. It was included in the artist Julie Ault’s contribution to the 2014 Biennial in an installation titled\nAfterlife: a constellation\n, which was expanded for a 2016 exhibition at Galerie Buchholz in New York titled\nAfterlife\n. In these installations, Ault combined texts, artworks by other artists, artifacts, and found items. Also included with both installations is a printed out text of an interview between Ault and Marvin Taylor about Wojnarowicz's Magic Box.\n[2]\nIn these installations, Ault displayed the box and it contents strewn across a plinth under Plexiglas.\nImages from The David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library & Special Collections\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Magic_Box&oldid=4326\n\"\nCategories\n:\nSculpture\nCase Studies\nThis page was last modified on 20 May 2017, at 09:50.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

The completed film from Mexico is called: A FIRE IN MY BELLY.”\nWojnarowicz went on to describe the film, saying:\nIt contains documentary footage shot in border towns and in Mexico City. After completing shooting in Mexico I returned to New York City and shot footage in the studio which I spliced into scenes from Mexico. The film deals with ancient myth and it’s [sic] modern counterpart. It explores structures of power and control--using at times the fire ants north of mexico city [sic] as a metaphor for social structure. What I explored in the film is the workings within surface image; so I split open continuous images and placed studio shots or other related images within the splice – the film uses spliced in-images almost as subliminal messages but each is used at least long enough to register on the brain; sometimes longer. I explore spectacle in the form of the wrestling matches that occur in small arenas in the poor neighborhoods where myth is an accepted part of the sport; the guys with fantastic masks are considered the \"good guys\" whearas those without masks are personifications of evil. These images are interspersed with cockfights and t/v/ [sic] bullfights. There are sections pertaining to power and control; images of street beggars and little children blowing ten foot long flames among cars at an intersection. Images of armored trucks picking up bank receipts. Images of loaves of bread being sewn up as well as a human mouth--control and silencing through economics. There are invasive aspects of christianity [sic] played against images of day of the dead and the earthquake buildings and mummies of northern mexico [sic]. There are symbols of rage and the need for release.\nIn the timeline he created for the catalog that accompanied the exhibition, however, Wojnarowicz listed\nA Fire In My Belly\nunder “Films/Videos/Recordings” from 1987, and described it thusly:\nA Fire in My Belly, filmed in Mexico City and various border towns as well as NYC, black and white and color super-8 (went through 2 versions then disassembled for other projects), 30 minutes\n[1]\nJames Romberger's Account\nJames Romberger\n, Wojnarowicz’s friend and sometimes collaborator, wrote that Wojnarowicz had shown him one of those completed versions, sometime in 1987. On his website, Romberger wrote:\nI am one of the few who saw David’s original film. He showed it to me privately at his apartment (formerly Hujar’s residence, over the movie theater on 2nd Avenue) in 1987 when we began collaboration on our graphic novel Seven Miles a Second. He had me sit in front of his big TV, next to his baby elephant’s skeleton and insisted that I watch his Mexican film. What followed was an assault on my senses, a view of a world completely out of control. The strobed, often violent scenes of wrestlers, cock and bull fights, lurid icons, impoverished dwellings, clanking engines, an enslaved monkey, cripples begging for coins, for bread, a burning, spinning globe—it was a picture of indifference to the value of life, Mexico as a grinding machine of poverty and cruel spectacle. I didn’t enjoy the experience. The images and soundtrack combined to create a powerful feeling of unease and angst. I was obviously shaken as it ended, but David just laughed. We moved on to discuss our intention for the comic book, still the afteraffects were hard to shake. He told me later that he had disassembled that first version.\n[2]\nAt the Fales Library\nThe Fales Library and Special Collections acquired the David Wojnarowicz Papers in 1997, five years after Wojnarowicz’s death, and eleven years after the initial filming for\nA Fire In My Belly\n. Included in that acquisition was a post-production shooting script titled\nA Fire In My Belly,\nwhich outlined eight different sections to the film, along with potential themes and specific shots for each section. No extant version of\nA Fire In My Belly\nconforms exactly to this script. The script itself is a work in progress, with some elements crossed out and some handwritten notes suggesting that Wojnarowicz was considering combining some of the sections together.\nThe 1997 acquisition also included an aluminum canister labeled \"A Fire in My Belly, A Work in Progress,” which contained a Super 8mm reel of the unfinished film. This reel displays title cards at the beginning (“A Fire in My Belly”) and end (“Film in Progress David Wojnarowicz 1986-7”), echoing the text on the outside of the film canister. This unfinished workprint includes footage from Mexico and New York, but does not include everything listed on the shooting script, nor some of the footage that James Romberger attests to have seen in a “completed” version of\nA Fire In My Belly\n. This version is silent.\nIn 2000, the Fales Library and Special Collections acquired a second Super 8mm reel of film, in an aluminum canister labeled \"Mexico, etc... Peter, etc…For Michael Lupetin.” This footage echoes the shooting script from the original acquisition, and includes shots taken in Mexico of amputees, industrial machinery, ants on coins, beggars, mummified corpses, zoo animals, policeman, Mayan ruins, and ants crawling on a crucifix, all spliced with footage taken in New York, including images of sewn bread, Jesus blinking, coins being poured into a blood-filled bowl, Jesse Hultberg underdressing and masturbating, flowers on water, an illustration of Jesus lit up by fireworks, and a burning globe. A majority of the frames do not appear on \"A Work in Progress,\" although some are closely related. This reel contains no title cards.\nIn\nSilence=Death\nThe “Michael Lupetin” mentioned on the canister acquired by Fales in 2000 was a producer on German director\nRosa von Praunheim’s\n1990 experimental documentary\nSilence=Death,\nwhich examined AIDS through the experiences of several gay male artists, including Wojnarowicz, Allen Ginsberg, and Keith Haring.\nAccording to\nMarion Scemama\n, Wojnarowicz’s collaborator for\nSilence=Death:\n[I]n April 1989, David called me in Paris and asked me to come to New York with a video camera. Rosa von Praunheim was in New York to make a documentary about AIDS-artists with AIDS-so he chose different artists, writers, painters, and David was one of them….\nI accompanied David each time he would work with Rosa and help prepare the scenes. David was free to do what he wanted, but he wasn’t really sure of what he wanted to do. The idea was to imagine the structure of life, death, sexuality, through the eyes of someone who was a social outcast: a homosexual who has AIDS.\n[3]\nIn the end, Wojnarowicz included footage from “Mexico, etc…”, a new dream sequence shot with Scemama and artist Paul Smith, and a recording of him reading his own work, along with audio of him being interviewed by von Praunheim. The shots from “Mexico, etc…” are included under a soundtrack of Wojnarowicz reading and being interviewed, which then transitions into Diamanda Gallas’s song “This is The Law of the Plague.” Although these shots are in roughly the same order as they appear on the original Super 8mm reel labeled “Mexico, etc...” in the Fales Library, they have been edited down and intercut with other footage.\nIn 2007 Semiotext(e) uploaded the\nSilence=Death\nclip to YouTube, including Diamanda Galas's music, with a fabricated title card that read “Fire in my belly Musique: Diamanda Galas,” over a zoomed-in image of Wojnarowicz’s “Street Kid” collage. This title card was made under the supervision of Marion Scemama, who created it for screenings in Paris celebrating the release of the French language edition of\nClose to the Knives\n. This edit was created after Wojnarowicz's death.\nIn\nHide / Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture at the National Portrait Gallery\nIn 2010, curator\nJonathan David Katz\nand artist\nBart Everly\ncreated a new version of\nA Fire In My Belly\nfor\nHide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture,\nan exhibition at the Smithsonian Museum’s National Portrait Gallery. This re-edited version was authorized by the Wojnarowicz estate, and used Wojnarowicz’s segment in\nSilence=Death\nas a guide. It includes at least one frame from every individual shot on\nMexico, etc...,\nalthough not in the same order or for the same duration as in the original. Instead of\nDiamanda Gallas\n, this version used audio from a 1989 ACT UP demonstration, attended by Wojnarowicz and found among his papers in the Fales Library, as its soundtrack. The inclusion of this version (in particular, an eleven second sequence of fire ants crawling on a crucifix), ignited a major controversy over the exhibition as a whole. When\nA Fire In My Belly\nwas removed from the exhibition by then-Secretary of the Smithsonian, Wayne Clough, other museums and institutions around the world began to show this as the definitive version of\nA Fire In My Belly\n, unaware of its complicated history.\nConfigurations\nThere are several configurations of what came to be titled and exhibited as\nA Fire In My Belly\nat galleries and museums internationally, most of which were not edited or titled by Wojnarowicz himself.\nA Fire in My Belly A Work In Progress\nSuper 8mm 1986-1987, 00:13:00m\nTitle written by David Wojnarowicz on original aluminum canister housing.\nThis is the only reel that opens with the title card \"A Fire in My Belly\" and ends with the title card \"Film in Progress David Wojnarowicz 1986-7\" and a thank you card.\nIn this version, Wojnarowicz interlayed scenes of poverty on the streets of Mexico, Mexican newspaper headlines, Mayan ruins, Mexican wrestling (focusing heavily on Lucha Libre masked fighters), bull fighting (filmed off of the television,) cock fighting (filmed in San Juan, Puerto Rico,) and a local Mexican circus. Wojnarowicz also spliced in footage he took in New York of Mexican tarot cards, prints of trains, a Frankenstein mask, spinning eyeballs, a burning map of Mexico, bloodied and bandaged hands, water poured over hands, and falling coins. This version is silent.\nMexico, etc... Peter, etc…For Michael Lupetin\nSuper 8mm 1986-1987, 00:07:00m excerpt\nTitle written by David Wojnarowicz on original aluminum canister housing.\nWojnarowicz created this reel from footage filmed in Mexico, New York studio footage, and footage of Peter Hujar on his deathbed. The Mexico and New York footage is likely from a dismantled, in progress, version of A Fire in My Belly.\nThe Mexico footage, which echoes the post-production shooting script labeled\nA Fire in My Belly,\nincludes amputees, industrial machinery, ants on coins, beggars, mummified corpses, zoo animals, policeman, different Mayan ruins, ants crawling on a crucifix, spliced with footage taken in New York, such as images of sewn bread, Jesus blinking, coins being poured in a blood-filled bowl, Jesse Hultberg underdressing and masturbating, flowers on water, and an illustration of Jesus lit up by fireworks, and a burning globe. A majority of the frames relate to, but do not appear on,\nA Work in Progress.\nThis version is silent.\nRosa von Praunheim’s\nSilence=Death\n00:04:10m excerpt, beginning at 00:49:21m, 1989-1990\nThis edit, done by Wojnarowicz with help from his frequent collaborator Marion Scemama, includes scenes from\nMexico, etc...\npresented in their original order, but edited down and intercut with other footage. The first three minutes of the segment are accompanied by audio from an interview between Wojnarowicz and von Praunheim, before Diamanda Galas’s\nThis is the Law of the Plague\ncomes on (beginning at 00:52:18), over footage of ants crawling on a crucifix, filmed in Mexico.\nA Fire in My Belly\n: Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery edit, 2010 00:04:15m Video\nThis version was created by Bart Everly, with direction from Jonathan David Katz and permission from the Wojnarowicz estate, for the\nHide/Seek\nexhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery in 2010. It is viewable on\nBart Everly’s website\n. The title card incorrectly states that it is “30 Minutes,” but it is actually 4:15m.\nThis version was created from footage on the reel labeled\nMexico...etc...\nIn an interview, Katz explained that he created this piece because he wanted to show some of Wojnarowicz’s film work, but none of his pieces were under the four-minute time limit imposed by the National Portrait Gallery. As\nA Fire In My Belly\nwas never a finished work, and Wojnarowicz had previously allowed Rosa von Praunheim to edit the footage, Katz felt comfortable re-editing that material. His specific goal was to make an edit that was explicitly about HIV/AIDS.\n[4]\nThis version uses a recording of a 1989 ACT UP demonstration, attended by Wojnarowicz, as its soundtrack. The use of this soundtrack was approved by the Wojnarowicz Estate and given to the Smithsonian by Fales Library and Special Collections.\nAccording to PPOW Gallery (which represents the Wojnarowicz estate), the following institutions have purchased this version:\nPulitzer Art Foundation\nThe Whitney Museum of Art\nThe Addison Gallery of American Art\nLeslie + Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art\nColección MUAC\nYoutube versions:\nMichael Lupetin\n(2015) and\nSemiotext(e)\n(2007)\nUploads:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhpG7Gtqrrc\nThese versions are both identical to the edit in\nSilence=Death\nfrom the point at which Diamanda Galas's\nThis is the Law of the Plague\nbegins playing. The first four seconds is silent, with a title card depicting a blown-up photograph of Wojnarowicz's Street Kid collage, overlaid with the words: \"Fire in my belly Musique: Diamanda Galas\" The creator of the title card was Marion Scemama, for Semiotext(e), in honor of the publication of the French version of Wojnarowicz’s book\nClose to the Knives.\nNo Censorship in America Upload (2010)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHRCwQeKCuo\nA DVD of this version was given to PPOW Gallery by Fales Library and Special Collections. It contains the entirety of\nFire in My Belly, A Work in Progress\nand the entirety of\nMexico, etc…,\nwith a brief blank screen in between. It was uploaded to YouTube by the organization No Censorship in America.\nMexico Film Footage\nand\nMexico Film Footage II\nTitles created during processing at Fales Library and Special Collections\nSoundtracks\nNo Soundtrack (silent)\nWojnarowicz's two original Super 8mm reels (\nA Work in Progress\nand\nMexico, etc…\n) had no audio.\n1989 Act-Up Demonstration, Audio-cassette 00:04:00m excerpt\nThis audio was used in the version of\nA Fire In My Belly\ncreated by Bart Everly and Jonathan David Katz for the\nHide/Seek\nexhibition at the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum. The audio includes Wojnarowicz's voice among fellow protesters. The use of this soundtrack was approved by the Wojnarowicz estate and given to the Smithsonian by Fales Library and Special Collections.\nDiamanda Galas’\nThis is the Law of the Plague\nThis audio was included in the 00:04:10m edit in Rosa von Praunheim’s 1990 documentary\nSilence=Death,\nin the widely viewed Semiotext(e) YouTube video, uploaded in 2007, and in the 2015 YouTube video uploaded by Michael Lupetin (which is itself identical to the Semiotext(e) YouTube version).\nMexico Soundtrack 1/4\" (F-2) Maxell XLII 90 audiocassette, 00:30:17\nIt cannot be said definitively whether this soundtrack was meant to be the official soundtrack for\nA Fire in My Belly.\nWojnarowicz created this tape with Doug Bressler, and it includes Bressler's guitar combined with the street sounds of Mexico, as well as Wojnarowicz whispering the words “Go inside your own head, and you can do all these things – easy as drawing blood out through a needle.” Cynthia Carr, in her biography of Wojnarowicz, said that the soundtrack was never synced with the workprint,\n[5]\nalthough this contradicts Romberger, who claimed to have watched a workprint of the film that included a soundtrack.\n[6]\nMedia & Techniques\nWojnarowicz used a Super 8mm camera and Kodak Super 8mm triacetate film, both color and black and white, for all footage, including both\nA Fire in My Belly, A Work in Progress\nand\nMexico...etc...Peter..etc\nIt is likely that Wojnarowicz bought his Super 8mm film from Rafik's OP Screening Room, evidenced by phone logs, included in the David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library and Special Collections.\nIn 1986-87, Wojnarowicz experimented with Super 8mm film in New York. His partner, Tom Rauffenbart, sometimes assisted with filming. Wojnarowicz took footage of Rauffenbart placing flowers on water, which would appear in\nMexico...etc...\nWojnarowicz also had Rauffenbart pose his hands, wrapped in bandages, with coins and containers of blood. Rauffenbart would also be filmed with his lips artificially sewn shut. The blood was created with red food coloring and the string was glued to red yarn, and then placed carefully over Rauffenbart's lips.\nWojnarowicz filmed in Mexico from October 29th-November 18th, 1986. He brought props with him to Teotihuacan, a site of ancient Aztec ruins, including watch faces, a toy gun, a toy soldier, a small Day of the Dead skull, candles, a sign, and a plastic crucifix. Wojnarowicz had heard that the Aztec site was riddled with fire ants and intended to film and photograph them crawling among his props.\n[5]\nLocations\nMexico\nWojnarowicz entered Nuevo Laredo, Mexico with\nTommy Turner\non October 29th, 1986, equipped with two Super 8 cameras and two 35mm cameras. They took a train to Mexico City the same day. Turner, who was wrestling with a heroin addiction, used a deck of tarot cards, which appear in Wojnarowicz's Mexico footage, to help him find a spiritual path towards sobriety. On October 31st, Turner and Wojnarowicz traveled by bus to Guanajuato, where they both shot footage at a mummy museum, including some shots that would end up in\nMexco...etc...Peter...etc\n.\nWojnarowicz and Turner returned to Mexico City for the Day of the Dead Parade, held on November 2nd, 1986. Although they shot footage during the parade, these were not featured in\nA Fire in My Belly\nconfigurations and were not included in Wojnarowicz's journals.  After the parade, they took a bus through the Coyoacan section of Mexico City, filming the aftermath of a deadly earthquake, prominently featured in Wojnarowicz's\nMexico, etc…\nfootage. They intended to go to a local cemetery but were sidetracked by advertisements for a circus. Wojnarowicz filmed the event, seen in\nA Work in Progress.\nTurner and Wojnarowicz attended a Lucha Libre wrestling match, hiring a cab driver as an interpreter to narrate the show. These filmed moments appear in\nA Work in Progress\nbut only due to luck. Wojnarowicz and Turner almost had their cameras confiscated by security guards for not having a permit. They were able to keep their film with a small bribe of 1000 pesos. They were approached by guards again before they would stop recording the event.\nWojnarowicz and Turner planned to go to Teotihuacan together on November 3rd, 1986, where there were ancient Aztec ruins. Filming fire ants was a priority for Wojnarowicz. Footage from Teotihuacan can be seen in both\nA Work in Progress\nand\nMexico...etc...Peter...etc\n.\nAfter Turner and Wojnarowicz parted ways on November 5th, 1986, Wojnarowicz went back to Mexico City alone until November 18th, where he continued to film.\n[5]\nThe footage listed below was filmed in Mexico, as determined by reading Cynthia Carr's\nFire in the Belly: The Life and Times of David Wojnarowicz,\nand by multiple viewings of Wojnarowicz's films.\nA Fire in My Belly, A Work in Progress\nStreets of Mexico City\nMexican Newspapers\nLivestock in the streets\nMexican man on street with Lucha Libre action figures\nLucha Libre magazines\nLucha Libre Match\nBull Fight on Mexican television\nYoung male firebreather on streets of Mexico City\nCircus\nMayan ruins\nWalking through Mexico City streets with demon mask\nMexico...etc...Peter...etc...\nIndustrial Machinery\nLegless Amputees\nBegging woman\nMexican police officers\nLucha Libre Match\nMayan/Aztec ruins\nAnts crawling on coins\nMexican Zoo\nMummy Museum\nPainted Day of the Dead figures\nDriving through Mexico City streets\nFirebreather\nAnts crawling on plastic crucifix\nLaying water on graves\nDay of the Dead and red candles with rotting fruit, money, and ants\nMan on telephone wire, hitting concrete with sledgehammer\nNew York\nSome frames from both\nA Work in Progress\nand\nMexico... etc...

It features a school portrait of David Wojnarowicz from his childhood, (the type that is traditionally encountered in wallet-sized prints or framed on family mantelpieces), surrounded by black text. The school photo is blown up and rendered in black-and-white, like a newspaper broadsheet, removing the photograph from a more intimate and traditional school or family context. In contrast with the image of the smiling child, the printed text surrounding the portrait embeds the image in a network of social, institutional, medical, and physical violence. Beginning with the words “One day this kid will get larger…” the text goes on to narrate a series of events in this child’s growing awareness of his sexual desires, and the lifetime of persecution, resistance, and struggle that come with his identification as a gay man. With each declarative statement, Wojnarowicz catalogs the homophobic violence perpetrated against gay men by governments, religious institutions, families and neighbors.\nFull text:\n“One day this kid will get larger. One day this kid will come to know something that causes a sensation equivalent to the separation of the earth from its axis. One day this kid will reach a point where he senses a division that isn’t mathematical. One day this kid will feel something stir in his heart and throat and mouth. One day this kid will find something in his mind and body and soul that makes him hungry. One day this kid will do something that causes men who wear the uniforms of priests and rabbis, men who inhabit certain stone buildings, to call for his death. One day politicians will enact legislation against this kid. One day families will give false information to their children and each child will pass that information down generationally to their families and that information will be designed to make existence intolerable for this kid. One day this kid will begin to experience all this activity in his environment and that activity and information will compell [sic] him to commit suicide or submit to danger in hopes of being murdered or submit to silence and invisibility. Or one day this kid will talk. When he begins to talk, men who develop a fear of this kid will attempt to silence him with strangling, fists, prison, suffocation, rape, intimidation, drugging, ropes, guns, laws, menace, roving gangs, bottles, knives, religion, decapitation, and immolation by fire. Doctors will pronounce this kid curable as if his brain were a virus. This kid will lose his constitutional rights against the government’s invasion of his privacy. This kid will be faced with electro-shock, drugs, and conditioning therapies in laboratories tended by psychologists and research scientists. He will be subject to loss of home, civil rights, jobs, and all conceivable freedoms. All this will begin to happen in one or two years when he discovers he desires to place his naked body on the naked body of another boy.”\nThemes\nPre-invented world\nWojnarowicz was deeply concerned about the power of mass media to reinforce the myths of what he called the “pre-invented world,” the “official reality” whose social rules, regulations, definitions, and expectations he sought to interrogate. As he wrote in an unpublished manuscript, “We are living in the midst of a schizophrenic period in which mass media/mass hypnosis as engineered by rich white straight men and fake religious types uses language and symbols to manipulate emotions and distract us from the reality at hand”\n[1]\nBy taking advantage of print-making technologies to make multiples and widen the distribution of his art, as he increasingly turned to in the late 1980s, Wojnarowicz turned the tools and techniques of mass media against the pre-invented world to develop new narratives.\nChildhood\nWojnarowicz spoke and wrote frequently about his childhood, but this is the only time he used an actual childhood photograph of himself in a visual artwork. [confirm] Elsewhere in his work, imagery of babies and children recur, such as\nBurning Child\n, 1984, a child mannequin covered with map fragments and acrylic paint, which was photographed by Wojnarowicz in different settings, and included in various installations, including the 1984 solo exhibition at\nGracie Mansion\n. Drawing from his own personal experience, Wojnarowicz often depicted childhood as a time of danger and oppression.\nActivism\nAlthough he is primarily remembered today for his fierce AIDS activism (particularly after the death of his mentor\nPeter Hujar\nin 1987 and his own diagnosis with AIDS shortly afterwards), Wojnarowicz's art and writings evidenced a broad social critique of injustice throughout his lifetime. He identified with marginal figures - drug addicts, homeless people, prisoners, people with AIDS, queer people - and sought to make obvious the cruelty and hypocrisy of powerful people who persecuted them. In his work, Wojnarowicz targeted specific groups who, through ignoring AIDS crisis or criminalizing homosexuality, were directly complicit in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. His contribution to\nNan Goldin's\n1989 exhibition\nWitnesses: Against Our Vanishing\n, an essay “Post Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell,” was a particularly controversial piece that spoke directly to the rage, sorrow and indignation about the AIDS crisis and the callousness of the establishment, and it led to the National Endowment of the Arts withdrawing its financial support for the catalogue. This was a deeply upsetting experience for Wojnarowicz that weighed heavily on his mind during this period, as he continued to fight for AIDS awareness, the rights of artists, and freedom from censorship.\nOne Day This Kid…\nhas a searing political message, juxtaposing the innocence of Wojnarowicz as a child with the cruelty of those who would persecute him for his sexual desires, and insisting on the potential of art to act as political instrument.\nOne Day This Kid...\nwould eventually be turned into poster and postcards sized versions, vastly increasing its reach as a piece of agitprop.\nMedia and Techniques\nOne Day This Kid…\nis an edition of 10 Photostats produced between 1990 and 1991.  Photostatting is a commercial process in which a camera is used to make direct copies.\n[2]\nThe Photostat machine camera photographs the desired image (a document, another photograph, or a collaged layout) directly onto sensitized paper, without using film. This produces a paper negative that is then re-photographed onto the same type of sensitized paper in order to produce a positive print in as many copies as desired. Photostat was an early form of document reproduction that largely went out office use by the 1950s. The Photostat process continued to be used, however, by graphic design industry that needed to create large print copies of irregular layouts of image and text.\nWojnarowicz learned how to use a commercial Photostat machine at a short-lived summer job at an ad agency in 1979, and he used the machine at the agency to create Rimbaud masks for\nArthur Rimbaud in New York\n(1978–1979).\n[3]\nFor\nOne Day This Kid…\n, Wojnarowicz did not produce the Photostats himself, but rather enlisted the help of\nJean Foos\n, and the production department at\nArtforum.\nAccording to Foos:\nI was employed as the designer at Artforum and had received permission from the publishers* to use their facilities to work on the exhibition catalogue\nDavid Wojnarowicz: Tongues of Flame\n. Their in-house set up included Compugraphic typesetting equipment and a photostat camera as well as help from the staff. The plan was to design and produce David’s catalogue during the off-weeks when the magazine was not on deadline. As the catalogue for the Illinois show project grew ever larger, David started getting ready for a show at\nPPOW\nas well.\nOne Day This Kid…\nwas originally planned and produced to be just a page for\nTongues of Flame.\nThis was shortly before Macs were available so the process of setting the type required sketching the layout on tracing paper, counting characters, and measuring each line so it would break exactly in the right spot. Typesetter Nicole Potter patiently and expertly set and reset the text to David’s satisfaction. Once we had assembled the mechanical for that page with the silhouetted halftone photo, David was able to use that for bigger prints, as in the edition printed later at Giant Photo, New York.\n[4]\nAt the time, Wojnarowicz was spending a significant portion of his materials budget printing Photostats.\n[5]\nDavid also had us work on typesetting for the texts on his flower paintings. I can’t recall if we worked on this while the catalogue was in production or shortly after. David typed out the text and then Nicole Potter and I worked to set the type in the proportions to fit each painting—so they could be blown up and silkscreened over each painting. He sent 9 texts which I have in my archive [see photos below], but I don’t know how many flower paintings he completed, some of the paintings have 2 texts on them.\nAntony Korner, Knight Landesman, and Charles Guarino were the publishers who allowed us free reign of the facilities—mostly at night and off hours. The project grew far beyond our expectations. I remember some tense moments when Barry Blinderman was daily faxing us corrections—past our deadlines we set—and while we were trying to get our magazine to the printer.\n[6]\nWojnarowicz had previously experimented with other forms of combining image and text through collaging printed text onto paintings and through silkscreening text on top of photographic prints. Though he had worked with Xerox and Photostats in the past, Wojnarowicz had only recently begun making editioned prints via his work with the Normal Editions Workshop at Illinois State University as part of his preparation for the Tongues of Flame exhibition. In contrast to his earlier photo/text works, with the Photostat images printed at Giant Photo and with the lithographic work he was producing at Normal, text and image were printed via the same process, lending a commercial poster-like quality to the resulting prints.\nWhile creating the work, Wojnarowicz experimented with different Xerox prints of the childhood photograph, on varied types of paper. These can be found, along with versions of the text in progress, in the David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales.\nOne Day This Kid…\nwas also produced as a German edition, with German text, in 1990 under the title\nEines Tages…\n, published by ACT-UP Berlin and the artist (edition size unknown). Posthumously, it was released as a letterpress edition of 100 as a fundraiser for Printed Matter in 2012, in collaboration with the Estate of David Wojnarowicz. It sold out in one day.\nLocations\nNew York City\n,\nEast Village\nWojnarowicz did the primary production of this work in New York, during a period in which he was increasingly involved in political activism around the AIDS crisis, public debates around medical research, arts funding, and legal rights of artists (see “Activism” theme above).\nNormal, IL\nAlthough this work was not included in\nTongues of Flame\n, the work is published as a full-page plate on page 30 of the exhibition catalogue, and was used as the primary image on the announcement card for subsequent venues. Wojnarowicz produced it while working with\nBarry Blinderman\non the exhibition and with\nJean Foos\non the catalogue. The catalogue also includes an excerpt from\nClose to the Knives\nby Wojnarowicz that echoes\nOne Day This Kid…\nand seems to refer to its genesis: “A number of months ago I read in the newspaper that there was a supreme court ruling which states that homosexuals in America have no constitutional rights against the government’s invasion of their privacy…When I read the newspaper article I felt something stirring in my hand…Realizing that I have nothing left to lose in my actions I let my hands become weapons, my teeth become weapons, every bone and muscle and fiber and ounce of blood become weapons, and I feel prepared for the rest of my life.”\n[7]\nPeople\nBarry Blinderman\nBlinderman organized Wojnarowicz's 1990 solo retrospective\nTongues of Flame\nat llinois State University Art Galleries.\nOne Day This Kid...\nwas not included in the exhibition, but was included in the accompanying catalog.\nJean Foos\nWojnarowicz worked with artist and graphic designer Jean Foos on the layout and production of this work, preparing it for inclusion in the\nTongues of Flame\ncatalogue.\nNan Goldin\nGoldin was a contemporary of Wojnarowicz in the Lower East Side art movement of the nineteen eighties. Goldin asked Wojnarowicz to contribute to an exhibition she was curating for Artist's Space Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing, about the ongoing AIDS crisis. Wojnarowicz's contribution became the center of an NEA controversy when the NEA withdrew funding for the exhibition, in part based on the language in Wojnarowicz's catalogue essay \"Postcards from America: X-Rays from Hell.\"\nJason Woodson\nWoodson is a visual artist, whose work\nOne Day This Kid (20 years on)\nwas inspired by Wojnarowicz's\nOne Day This Kid..\nCuratorial Information\nProvenance\nInstitutional collections include Jersey City Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Wadsworth Athenaeum, Smith College, and\nWhitney Museum of American Art\n. Note that Art Institute of Chicago lists their version as a gelatin silver print from an edition of 10. The US National Museum of Medicine has a poster print of the German language version,\nEines Tages...\nExhibition History\nOne notable exhibition of\nOne Day This Kid…\nduring Wojnarowicz’s lifetime was its inclusion in his installation\nAmerica: Heads of Family/Heads of State\n, produced for\nThe Decades Show: Frameworks of Identity\nin the 1980s at the\nNew Museum of Contemporary Art\nin New York City in 1990.\nOne Day This Kid...\nanchored the installation, hung (unframed) on the back wall of a small room lined with unframed photographic portraits of politicians (including Ronald Reagan and Jesse Helms) and his own family. At the center of the room, a large, blindfolded papier-mâché head was suspended from an altar of branches, painted with the word “QUEER” over its forehead. Underneath the head, two video monitors played footage from\nITSOFOMO\n. On the floor, a child skeleton in a white dress was placed on a bed of twigs and flowers, and a village constructed of small model houses, twigs, and other found objects was strewn across the back half of the room. In his private notes, Wojnarowicz described this installation as “formal pieces unravel into chaos + noise”\n[8]\n, suggesting that\nOne Day This Kid…\nwas a “formal piece” that nonetheless encompassed the range of chaos represented by the installation.\nCritical reception\nAs critic Maurice Berger wrote about encountering the piece in 1990, “The juxtaposition of freckle-faced, jug eared kid with the poisonous reality of homophobia moved me deeply. And while I have been ‘out’ for almost a decade, the work helped me to accept a part of my queer self that I had never before owned; the gay bashed, self-hating kid that struggled to survive.”\n[9]\nSince its first exhibition and publication,\nOne Day This Kid…\nhas been a powerful icon for gay rights, and has found new resonance in the wake of continued violence and discrimination against the gay community in the twenty-five years since its publication.  It is among Wojnarowicz’s most well-known works, in part because of its circulation as a postcard at progressive bookstores throughout New York City. It now finds further distribution through digital channels;  many Twitter and Tumblr users shared images of the work in response to the Orlando nightclub mass shooting in June of 2016, for example.\nOther artists and activists have used the work to create their own renditions, such as the artist\nJason Woodson\n, who created\nOne Day This Kid…(20 Years On)\n(2010), which recasts the central photo in a rainbow gradient, and rewrites the text to address continued violence amidst newer concerns of the hypocrisy of the simultaneous commodification of the gay community.\nArchival Material for One\nDay This Kid...\nfrom the Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library\nRelated Works\nAmerica: Heads of Family/Heads of State\nReferences\n↑\nJournal, Series I, Box 2, Folder 28,\nDavid Wojnarowicz Papers, Fales Library & Special Collections\n↑\nSee Joy Bloser’s paper on this topic on this site.

Milliken Gallery, December 1982\nAlexander Milliken established the Milliken Gallery. In 1982, Ed Baynard was curating a group show for the gallery. He wanted figurative and expressionistic painters. He had wondered who had done the stencil of the burning house that was seen in SoHo and the East Village. Seeing his long time friend,\nPeter Hujar\n, he told him about the upcoming show and the stencil. Naturally Hujar knew Wojnarowicz was the one who created the piece. Baynard called Wojnarowicz and asked him to participate in the show. He said yes and created a diptych of Hujar on masonite board--his first\n\"bonafide painting,\"\naccording to Wojrnaowicz. This group show,\nFast\n, led to Milliken offering David his first solo show. After that show, Milliken invited Wojnarowicz to co-curate an exhibition with Richard Hambleton,\nThree-Part Variety\n. Wojnarowicz and Hambleton invited\nKiki Smith\n, Chuck Nanney,\nJean Foos\n,\nDirk Rowntree\n, Tseng Kwong Chi, and Nicolas Moufarrege, among others.

Francisco Chaparro. September 2015.\nResearchers involved in the development of this resource were challenged by the nature of David Wojnarowicz’ life and art.  His works often do not fit into typical art historical classifications of medium and style, nor do they fit into standard archival descriptions. As depicted in the diagram on the left designed by project researcher Francisco Chaparro, there is a complex web of relationships between David Wojnarowicz, his artworks, people he knew and worked with, places associated with him and his art, texts related to his work, and external resources that may be helpful to users of this knowledge base. This recognition drove us away from designing a hierarchical database towards a wiki platform that affords multiple linkages within the resource, promoting a deeper understanding of these relationships.\nTo illustrate these complex relationships, Wojnarowicz used the same images, objects and references in multiple contexts, allowing them to develop multiple meanings and functions.  One example of an object that was presented in multiple contexts is a life-sized shark that he covered with maps and exhibited as a component of his\nBurning Child\ninstallation\nat the\nGracie Mansion Gallery\nin 1984. The shark was also shown as a hanging sculpture apart from the installation in addition to appearing in photographs. It exists in his personal archive as both an independent artwork and an element of another artwork.\nThe Magic Box\n, depicted below on the right, is another example. It contains sixty-nine objects collected by Wojnarowicz, including plastic toys, jewelry, stones, feathers, seeds, and photographs.  The Magic Box disrupts archival and art historical concepts of classification, provenance, context and description since specific functions of the box and its contents are not known. Yet the combination of objects holds complex symbolic and material values that shed light on Wojnarowicz’ life and art.  Some objects were integrated into his art production and appear in his photographs and films; others were not. To make these links discoverable, should we identify the\nMagic Box\nand/or its components as artworks? Should we link them to multiple artworks on the wiki?\nMagic Box (n.d.). Courtesy of the artist and Galerie Buchholz, New York.\nAnother example of complex associations of Wojnarowicz’ objects that complicated our wiki design can be found in his\nstencils\n. They were used to produce graffiti, paintings, site-specific installations, and prints. Some of the stencils are associated with artworks at multiple locations over time, involving different people. In addition, many of the stencils are in poor condition, composed of ephemeral media, and in need of thorough research prior to conservation, exhibition, or publication. They are heavily soiled, torn, and evidence signs of use, all of which is considered integral to their history. Should conservators clean and repair them, or should the soiling and signs of deterioration be left to witness their history of use? How should we represent multiple viewpoints on the wiki?\nOne more example can be found in the Super 8 film fragments in the\nDowntown Collection of the Fales Library\nat New York University Fales. Some were spliced together in various combinations to make multiple films, as in the four versions of the “Mexico” films analyzed by project researcher Regina Harsanyi. Some of these fragments were never used, although Wojnarowicz intended to use them as evidenced by the storyboards in his notebooks. Various people were involved with the films, sometimes as actors, co-authors, producers, directors, camera operators, and editors. Often people played multiple roles, including as artists who featured Wojnarowicz in their own films or who were associated with his other works and exhibitions.\nIn addition to the complications of classifications, meanings, and associations, many of Wojnarowicz’ works, particularly his films and videos, were not completed during his life. Exhibiting an incomplete or posthumously assembled work has the problematic potential of misrepresenting his original intent. The current attention Wojnarowicz receives and the controversies surrounding the posthumous assemblage of his moving image and audio fragments make this research critical to scholars and professionals in the art world. Issues of appropriate conservation and exhibition practices, in addition to questions of authorship, authenticity, and artwork integrity that arise from Wojnarowicz’ work are relevant to many contemporary artists who employ ephemeral media, use conceptual strategies and create media installations.\nIn developing this resource, project researchers needed to distinguish fact from fiction, or at least to recognize a certain fluidity, since Wojnarowicz’ writings, and those of others,\nand\nour interviews all contain conflicting statements. For example, he wrote in his notebooks about real and fictional characters that need to be distinguished in the database. He and others gave contradictory details of his life, his art, and past exhibitions. We provide citations for our sources, and accept contradictions where they exist. In the future we plan to host multiple timelines of his life that illustrate contradictions in accounts of his biography to researchers.  We  invite researchers to contact us if they find errors, and encourage contributions from users of this resource.

This series emerged from a day he spent on Jones Beach with\nKeith Davis\nand Elayne King painting driftwood and creating a makeshift monolith.\n[1]\nThe works displayed at Hal Bromm were painted to resemble stylized fish and snakes. They were covered with iconography from elsewhere in Wojnarowicz’s work, including images of globes, falling men, and targets.\nThroughout 1984, he shifted from painting found items like driftwood and garbage can lids to creating sculpture more in the assemblage tradition. One sculptural work, which has since been dispersed or destroyed, was\nMetamorphosis,\n1984, which was shown in his last exhibition at\nCivilian Warfare\n. This work consisted of 23 plaster alien heads, fired in his home, which he painted or covered with pieces of maps; as the heads progressed, they showed signs of distress (painted or collaged bandages or wounds), and the final head was smashed. He said the piece was about “the evolution of consciousness,”\n[2]\nwhich was symbolized for Wojnarowicz by the number 23 (the number of genes in a chromosome).\nWhile traveling in Argentina with\nLuis Frangella\nin the spring of 1984, Wojnarowicz created the\nAltar for the People of Villa Miseria\nin response to a shantytown he visited. The work consisted of a painted wooden cabinet with a human figurine, a Mayan statue, and a loaf of bread sewn together with red thread (an image he revisited in the sculpture\nUntitled (Bread Sculpture)\n, 1988-89) displayed in different compartments. That year, he also began regularly working with animal skulls, skeletons, and mannequins, covering them with paint or paper and incorporating them into installations and/or exhibiting them as sculptures in themselves. One example is\nUntitled (Shark)\n, 1984, which consists of a found fiberglass sculpture of a shark, covered with decoupaged cut-outs of world maps and painted with acrylic. It hung from the ceiling in the\nBurning Child installation\nat Gracie Mansion in 1984. Later, it hung in the exhibition\nTongues of Flame\nat\nUniversity Galleries of Illinois State University\n, and was photographed and reproduced in the catalogue for that show.\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nFrom early on in his career, Wojnarowicz’s favored technique for creating sculpture involved working with found objects and transforming them through paint or paper collage. The latter was a particularly rich technique for Wojnarowicz, as covering natural forms like animal skulls with pre-printed materials like maps allowed him to juxtapose the themes of organized society and nature he explored throughout his work.\nConservation and display\nThe driftwood pieces are primarily displayed mounted on the wall, although in his exhibition at\nHal Bromm\nin 1983, some were placed on piles of sand on the floor. Wojnarowicz frequently hung sculptural pieces, such as\nUntitled (Shark)\n, and the hanging painted plaster heads and animal skulls covered with maps that he suspended from the central tree in the\nMnuchin installation\n. In these cases the sculptures were outfitted with hanging hardware. In his retrospective\nTongues of Flame\n, small sculptural works were displayed on pedestals under plexiglass, though Wojnarowicz was not involved in the exhibition design of this show.\n[3]\nSelected works\nAn Altar for the People of the Villa Miseria\n, 1984.

Courtesy of the Estate of David Wojnarowicz and P.P.O.W, New York\nWojnarowicz discussed how he first started working with stencils in an interview with\nCynthia Carr\n:\n\"\nJulie Hair\nhad a box of international symbols in stencil form. I thought, Oh, we should do stencils that they forgot, such as burning houses. You know, images of resistance or violence. They never make international symbols like that, so let’s develop the burning house, a falling man, the target-face person, and little soldiers.\"\n[1]\n.\nFrom the early 1980s on, these iconic images became closely associated with Wojnarowicz. He used them on posters advertising his band\n3 Teens Kill 4\n, on individual prints, and applied to a variety of surfaces, including the walls and windows of\nabandoned warehouses along the West Side piers\n, the interior of galleries (see\n411 installation\n), streets, storefronts, and abandoned cars. Many recall first recognizing Wojnarowicz as the guy who was doing the burning house stencils around the Lower East Side.\n[2]\nAt the time, other artists (notably Keith Haring) were also spraypainting with stencils to create street art around the neighborhood, but Wojnarowicz’s work stood out with its distinctive imagery.\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\n5\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nStencil is one of four broad categories utilized to distinguish different types of fine art prints and includes cut-out and screenprinting techniques. Wojnarowicz, by using the cut-out technique, both by itself and in combination with other media, worked within the printmaking tradition while also expanding the limits of the medium.\nWojnarowicz created the cut-outs using free-hand drawings, or occasionally copied them from photographs or other reference images obtained from his archive of ephemera, of which he was a fervent collector. A stencil of\nPeter Hujar’s\nhead that was spraypainted onto the storefront of\nCivilian Warfare Studio\nand used in various paintings is an example of the latter; Wojnarowicz created it from a photograph he had taken of the artist. To do his stencils on the street, Wojnarowicz required a lookout. Artist\nJane Bauman\nrecalled that she would accompany him on stenciling trips, wandering the neighborhood after midnight.\n[3]\nThese prints were done hastily, and in the dark.\nTo make a stencil print, using the cut-out technique, Wojnarowicz applied spray paint through areas cut-out of a paper support to create a positive image. Wojnarowicz used this technique often and with great ingenuity to serially print his compositions of letters, symbols, shapes, and patterns on traditional supports like paper or wood, but also appropriated the urban landscape, stenciling walls, windows, cars or other found objects. With little to no formal art training, Wojnarowicz must have appreciated the inherent simplicity and versatility of the technique as a means to broadly disseminate his ideas.\nThe stencil templates were created by cutting away sections of a rigid paper support with a knife to create a negative of the intended composition. However, Wojnarowicz also utilized the positive cut-out portion as a stencil to print the inverse. His stencil print,\nCulture in Variation\n, for example, depicts a reoccurring motif in his work, a figure with his arm raised above is head in both formats.\nSurviving cut-out templates are mostly poster boards—a low cost, widely available material, ideal for Wojnarowicz who had little resources for art supplies at the height of his stencil use in the early 1980s. Once the design was cut-out, an impression was made by affixing the template to the chosen support—either with tape, but often with a spray adhesive (there are adhesive residues on extant Wojnarowicz stencils in the collection of the Fales Library, New York University)—and then spray painting over the templates to create the positive image. It would have been necessary to secure the template to the support regardless of whether working vertically or horizontally as the force of the air from the spray paint could disrupt it during image making. Images of the artist taken by Andreas Sterzing in 1983 reveal Wojnarowicz’s penchant for working horizontally on the floor—either because of preference or necessity—and they also reveal Wojnarowicz’s  collection of paints, brushes and other supplies scattered throughout the studio including numerous cans of Krylon paint which today is an icon of 1980s street art.\nKrylon was a go-to for many artists, including graffiti artists of the day, because of its general quality, low price, availability and range of colors. Spray paint was also appealing because it could cover a lot of surface area quickly, an advantage when, as in the case of street art, the act of creating the work was often illegal.  A range of colors including primaries, as well as a variety of bright colors including green, pink, yellow, orange and silver, can be found in existing stencil prints and in photo-documentation of his work in the Wojnarowicz Papers in the collection of Fales Library, New York University. One possible way of reconstructing his palette, albeit an unscientific one, would be using Krylon spray paint color charts by Borden from that time.\nWojnarowicz was masterful at achieving a broad range of effects with his use of spray paint, which inherently has a very flat and smooth finish. While some of his stencil prints were simple, depicting broad, flat fields of color, requiring one template and one color of paint like the original\nBurning House\n, others, like Wojnarowicz’s 1982 composition\nFiring Squad/Brick Wall\nwere technically sophisticated impressions composed on Bristol paper from multiple templates and layers of color. The use of spray paint to create works like this pushes the visual structure of printmaking, from the textural characteristics produced by the spray, depending on how much paint is applied and from what distance; and other, less predictable issues, such as how the mist settles on the surface or how colors intertwine.\nWojnarowicz likely purchased some of his papers to create prints like\nFiring Squad/Brick Wall\nfrom New York Central, known at the time for its vast selection and knowledge of artist’s papers. He noted that one of the art store clerks “knew everything there was to know about paper.”  Other than Strathmore Bristol, a high quality artist paper, Wojnarowicz used poor-quality papers like newsprint, supermarket posters, a ubiquitous printed material that he would return to throughout his career, and maps, which he liked to deconstruct the meaning of by literally ripping them up or through the stenciled symbols he applied.\nThe stencils that Wojnarowicz produced in the early 1980s were created with inexpensive materials and in a technically straightforward fashion. Wojnarowicz stenciled on nontraditional surfaces; he largely ignored the potential of editioning in his early works (most of his stencil prints are unique); and his process was direct—he was not reliant on the collaboration between printer and artist common to more technically demanding mediums like etching and lithography. Wojnarowicz clearly saw the medium’s potential as a means of communication and appreciated that, by creating prints on distinctive surfaces, the messages conveyed by the images he rendered would be intermingled with the connotations of the surface on which they were printed, thereby challenging conventional paradigms of technique, reproducibility, and dissemination.  These methods worked for Wojnarowicz because of their simple graphic power and speed of manufacture, and with stencil, the artist was able to have at hand reproducible imagery that could be widely distributed, from the street to gallery walls.\nConservation and display\nIn early exhibitions, Wojnarowicz hung the paper stenciled prints directly onto the wall, unframed (see\n411 installation\nfor images). There is no history of Wojnarowicz exhibiting the stencil cutouts themselves.\nThere is a substantial selection of stencils in the Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales. See\ninterview with conservator Laura McCann\non this site for additional information about their care at New York University.\nWorks on paper are inherently fragile objects. They are particularly susceptible to damage caused by mishandling, exposure to light and fluctuations and extremes of temperature and humidity. Damage caused by exposure to light is cumulative and irreversible and can cause fading of media and discolor or weaken paper. Wojnarowicz’s stencil prints on paper are no exception to these concerns. The constituent materials of each print (e.g., fiber composition of the paper, colorants and binder of each color of spray paint used) in combination with its unique display and storage history will affect its condition today.\nThe stencil templates, constructed out of paper, are equally as vulnerable as the prints themselves. The thin paper board Wojnarowicz used to construct them would easily have been damaged through use, especially the more intricately cut designs. Most of the stencil templates in the collection of the\nPPOW Gallery\nand the David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library appear to have been used on only a few occasions, as evidenced by the minimal layers of spray paint on them. This means that Wojnarowicz must have produced many stencils of his recurring motifs and discarded them as they became less suitable for use.\nWojnarowicz’s stenciled images rendered on the street pose altogether different preservation challenges than his stenciled prints on paper. These projects are preserved only through documentation—oral histories, photographs, and other primary sources. At the Hudson River Piers, for example, Wojnarowicz (with\nMike Bidlo\n) organized the\nWard Line Pier Project\nin1983, where he and other artists created projects on the walls of the abandoned and dilapidated warehouses, which have since been destroyed. Likewise, there is no photographic documentation of\nHunger\n, a rogue project in which Wojanrowicz and\nJulie Hair\nreportedly dumped a pile of cow bones and stenciled images in the stairwell of the Leo Castelli Gallery. Although Wojnarowicz subsequently recreated aspects of this project (in 1982, at the Gallery 345, in New York City), and stencil prints that appear to be a part of this process are contained in the collection of Fales Library, the original work is preserved only through oral and written accounts. While documentation can create a useful cultural record of these and Wojnarowicz’s other ephemeral, site-specific projects, it is important to consider that any efforts at reconstructing these works are influenced by the perspective of their source and that the works lose some of their meaning and impact divorced from their original context.\nSelected works\nUntitled (Burning House)\n, 1982.

This was in part due to his practice of experimenting with what was readily available, but also due to specific aesthetic decisions that emphasized variability and juxtaposition over a single resolved image.  For instance, Wojnarowicz typically used wood supports like Masonite, which could be precisely cut to produce windows for photographic or collaged inserts. He also used gelatin silver prints as support for a painting in order to reverse the typical figure-ground relationship, using an image as a base upon which to apply further layers. Wojnarowicz also used non-paint media in his paintings, incorporating pre-printed found material, string, Xeroxed images, photographs, drawings, and collage into his works. For paint, he typically used acrylic, enamel, and spray paint.\nThough Wojnarowicz became widely known for his paintings—the inclusion of two of his paintings in the 1985 Whitney Biennial was followed by a sold-out painting show at\nGracie Mansion Gallery\nin 1986—he thought of painting as just one of many image-making techniques available to him. “\"I have no attachment to style. The paintings that I do are just images that occur to me. I get them from the media, from conversations, and from distant memories.\"\n[1]\nIn painting, he could realize the images out of his own head, developing, deploying, and re-deploying a vocabulary of symbols that formed a repertoire of recurring imagery. Wojnarowicz further explains, “I had always believed that the content of paintings was some sort of denial of history—images preserved by and for a particular class of people. So it was in them that I reached for images of chaos—images that weren’t used in paintings.”\n[2]\nStatement by Jean Foos\nJean Foos\nis an artist who frequently collaborated with Wojnarowicz. According to Foos:\nWhen\nDirk\nintroduced me to David in 1979, I saw David as a writer first. I was just a year out of grad school and making big abstract paintings. I took it very seriously! David’s interest in image making seemed more like illustration or extension of his literary and musical ideas and not “fine art” to me (what did I know?). He made colored pencil drawings and color Xeroxed collages. At that time Dirk worked in a type shop and had access to typesetting, a stat camera and copiers. They both had a strong interest in experimenting and using the media—they challenged each other and shared many interests—Dirk can give more detail on that. I do recall David bringing by Egyptian and Mexican newspapers and magazines with grotesque and gory photos. In those days American papers were pretty conservative in what pictures were published, so the foreign papers had better raw material.\nWe didn’t really talk about color or composition, but more shared enthusiasms and resources and encouragement. He and\nBrian\nand I all shopped for frames one day on West 8th street because we were entering our work in the Small Works show at Washington Square East Galleries (rejected). He visited my studio at Union Square a few times—for open studios—and once to write out a recommendation to try to get me into the Clocktower studios. I never visited his painting studios. For his Flower paintings, I took his typed manuscripts and had them typeset to fit the shape of each painting so the text could be silkscreened on top. I have those original manuscripts.\nOne technical thing we talked about once was a way to make objects glow or pop by putting a halo around them; and it was something I did in my paintings and I’m sure you can find examples in David’s work.\nArchival Material from\nWojnarowicz Papers\n, Fales Library\nThis list of paint colors from the Wojnarowicz Papers shows the specific colors Wojnarowicz was working with circa 1990.\nReferences\n↑\nSteven Hager, “From Street to Salon,”\nNew York Beat\n, 16 May 1984, 17\n↑\nCynthia Carr,\nFire in the Belly: The Life and Times of David Wojnarowicz\n(New York, Bloomsbury, 2012): 5-6\nPages in category \"Painting\"\nThe following 4 pages are in this category, out of 4 total.\nI\nInstallation--Site-specific Paintings\nP\nPainting--Paint and Mixed Media on Canvas, Wood, and Masonite\nPainting--Paint and Mixed Media on Found Materials\nPainting--Paint and Mixed Media on Gelatin Silver Prints\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Category:Painting&oldid=4224\n\"\nCategory\n:\nMediums\nThis page was last modified on 20 April 2017, at 21:41.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nCategory\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

At the time he didn't have money to develop the film.\n[1]\nFrom this first foray into capturing images on film, photography formed a bedrock of Wojnarowicz’s practice. Wojnarowicz wrote that upon viewing years of negatives, “I realized that the photographs were like words in a sentence and what I try to do is construct paragraphs out of multiple images.”\n[2]\nWojnarowicz employed photography in various ways. In addition to producing standalone photographs and series, he used photography as ground for\npaintings\n, as source material, and as collaged elements in other works. He painted over, cut, pasted, made arrangements with, and rephotographed photographs. In the dark room, he produced his own prints and created complicated montages, though he also worked with others to create prints.  He used commercially available photographic work, such as a photomural used in an early exhibition at\nCivilian Warefare\n. He also kept photographic references he used as collaged images throughout his work, such as found porn.\n[3]\nPhotography also held particular political charge for Wojnarowicz. He saw it as a means for documenting the reality of lived experience that is often hidden from view, as well as a vehicle for creating alternative modes of seeing the world: “A photographic image can be a disruption of previously unchallenged power.”\n[4]\nReferences\n↑\nLucy Lippard, “Passenger on the Shadows,” in\nBrush Fires in a Social Landscape,\n2nd ed.

Sometimes these objects would make their way into an installation or film. Some of them he kept for himself, as private inspiration. He would manipulate some objects by painting them, collaging over them, affixing them to other items, or he would leave them as is. Some items, like papier-mache masks and plaster heads discussed on the pages below, he created entirely himself. Items that could fall under Wojnarowics’s “object practice” range from driftwood totems, plaster heads, skeletons, mannequins, or other props papered over with maps, toys, debris, and natural artifacts. It is often difficult to divide these into the categories laid out in the sections below—to designate a work as a finished sculpture and another as an “object.” We decided to designate as “sculpture” objects that were exhibited or photographed as individual works.

Courtesy of the Estate of David Wojnarowicz and PPOW New York\nBetween 1980 and 1983, Wojnarowicz was part of an art band called 3 Teens Kill 4 - No Motive (usually just referred to as 3 Teens Kill 4) with\nBrian Butterick\n,\nJesse Hultberg\n,\nJulie Hair\n, and later\nDoug Bressler\n. The name of the band came from a newspaper headline in The New York Post, and was chosen by\nMax Blagg\n. Blagg was only in the band briefly, but at the time, he was also publishing Wojnarowicz's first book,\nSounds In the Distance\n, through Aloes Books.\nJulie Hair\ndescribed the unusual sound of the band: “David used tapes as a lead guitar. Jesse [Hultberg] mostly played bass and guitar and Brian Butterick came in later and was playing piano. It was real arty. It wasn’t rock n’roll; it wasn’t punk. It wasn’t like anything else I can think of that was going on then or now for that matter. It was just kind of weird.”\n[1]\nWojnarowicz’s use of the tape recorder as an instrument demonstrated another variation of the sampling and remixing he used throughout his artistic practice.\nThe band recorded a self-produced album together in 1982,\nNo Motive\n, at a recording studio in the Bronx. Hair recalls that song-writing happened democratically, with the band members taking turns singing and sharing instruments.\nHultberg\nrecalls Wojnarowicz’s contributions to lyrics: “David was, you know, David was a poet and he just sort of rambled on sometimes, or he took stuff from his writings, and it was always interesting, sometimes dark, pretty dark, interesting.”\n[2]\nAfter David left the band, he was replaced by musician Bill Gerstel.\n[3]\nThe band continued to perform until 1987, and reunited briefly in 2010 and 2011.\nPhotographs\n[4]\nflyers and posters\n[5]\n, and audio\n[6]\nfor the band can be found in the Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library.\nReferences\n↑\n”Julie Hair,” in\nDavid Wojnarowicz: A definitive history of five or six years on the Lower East Side\n, Eds.

Poetry was his earliest - and least successful - artistic pursuit as an adult living on his own in New York City. Wojnarowicz had a conflicted relationship to language, considering it part of the \"pre-invented world\" that governed everything, and which he was always trying to break out of. But he also believed that writing could be used (like photography) to tell an alternative history that challenged those in power.\nSounds In the Distance\n(1982) /\nThe Waterfront Journals\n(1997)\nWojnarowicz collected the experiences of a wide-variety of marginal figures (whom he believed existed outside or on the edge of the pre-invented world), which he converted into (partially fictionalized) monologues. He published these monologues in the 1982 collection\nSounds in the Distance\n, published by\nMax Blagg\nat Aloes Books, London, with an introduction by William S. Burroughs. A number of the stories have been identified as being based on Wojnarowicz's own life, or at least they bear similarities to events that he narrated as his own experiences in other works.\nSounds in the Distance\nwas converted into a theatrical production by\nBill Rice\nin 1983. The production was put on by his theater company, Turmoil (which Rice founded with artists Allen Frame and Kirsten Bates), in the backyard of his building, and was thus dubbed\nTurmoil in the Garden.\nNan Goldin\nwas one of the performers.\nAfter Wojnarowicz's death,\nSounds in the Distance\nwas acquired by Grove/Atlantic Press, who reissued it in 1997 under the title\nThe Waterfront Journals.\nThis version included several additional monologues that Wojnarowicz had written after the publication of\nSounds in the Distance\n. This version was edited by\nAmy Scholder\n, who also wrote the introduction.\nMaterial relating to\nSounds in the Distance\ncan be found in the Wojanrowicz collection at the Fales Library, Series III, Subseries A, Container 1, Box 6.\nClose to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration\n(1991)\nClose to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration\nis a collection of some of Wojnarowicz's most powerful essays, which was published by Vintage (Random House) in 1991. The original cover was a close up of his photo\nUntitled (Buffalos).\nIt was subsequently re-released, in 2014, by Open Road Media, as part of a series of his books which included republished versions of\nMemories that Smell Like Gasoline\n,\nThe Waterfront Journals\n, and\nIn the Shadow of the American Dream\n. Each of these new editions features a black and white self-portrait on the cover.\nAccording to Cynthia Carr, Wojnarowicz let the publisher release it as nonfiction, \"even though he thought of it as 'a fusion of fiction and nonfiction.'\"\n[1]\nWojnarowicz had begun developing some of the essay Wojnarowicz as far back as the late seventies.\nThis collection includes \"Postcards from America: X-Rays from Hell,\" Wojnarowicz's piece for the catalog to\nNan Goldin's\n1990 show at Artist's Space\nWitnesses: Against Our Vanishing,\nwhich the NEA cited as the reason they withdrew funding from the show, sparking an enormous controversy over art and political speech. It also includes Wojnarowicz's most straightforward explanation of one of the central themes of his work, \"the pre-invented world:\"\nThe world of the stoplight, the no-smoking signs, the rental world, the split-rail fencing shielding hundreds of miles of barren wilderness from the human step. A place where by the virtue of having been born centuries late one is denied access to earth or space, choice or movement. The bought-up world; the owned world. The world of coded sounds: the world of language, the world of lies. The packages world; the world of speed in metallic motion. The Other World where I've always felt like an alien.\nThe original manuscript, notes, and some letters relating to\nClose to the Knives\ncan be found in the Wojanrowicz collection at the Fales Library, Series III, Subseries A, Container 1, Box 4.\nMemories that Smell Like Gasoline\n(1992)\nMemories that Smell Like Gasoline\nis an art book that was posthumously published by Artspace Books in 1992. The slim volume combined four short stories (all drawn from Wojnarowicz's life), with black and white watercolor paintings of anonymous gay sex in porn theaters, and ink drawings of his own sexual experiences.  It was subsequently re-released, in 2014, by Open Road Media, as part of a series of his books which included republished versions of\nClose to the Knives\n,\nThe Waterfront Journals\n, and\nIn the Shadow of the American Dream\n. Each of these new editions features a black and white self-portrait on the cover.\nAccording to Cynthia Carr,\nThe four stories were all about anonymous sex-the sweet pleasures of cruising but also the dangers. There's a constant sense in these texts of at least latent violence, which sometimes turns real and potentially deadly. The title story is about the night he was in the lobby of a movie theater and suddenly saw a man who'd raped him when he was a teenager... He also included the story, from the 1980 journal, about the night he met a deaf and mute man who followed him into the West Fourth Street subway station and, on the empty mezzanine between the Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines, began to simultaneously blow him and rob him... He wanted to analyze what he'd seen in this guy and in the other violent, unpredictable men he sometimes found himself attracted to. 'It's something about violence as a distancing tool to break down the organized world. It's the weird freedom in his failure to recognize the manufactured code of rules. The violence that floats liks static electricty that completely annihilates the possibility of future or security; I'm attracted to living like that,' he wrote in [the third] piece, titled \"Doing Time in a Disposable Body...\" The concluding story here, \"Spiral,\" is the last piece David ever wrote. Much of it is about AIDS, hospital visits to the latest dying friend, his reaction to some porn palace where no one's using a condom, and, at the end, a poetic evocation of fading away: \"I am growing tired. I am waving to you from here. I am crawling around looking for the aperture of complete and final emptiness. I am vibrating in isolation among you. I am screaming but it comes out like pieces of clear ice. I am signaling that the volume of all this is too high. I am waving. I am waving my hands. I am disappearing. I am disappearing but not fast enough.'\nMaterials relating to\nMemories that Smell Like Gasoline\n, can be found in the Wojanrowicz collection at the Fales Library, Series III, Subseries A, Container 1, Box 4.\n7 Miles a Second\n(1996)\nIllustrated by\nJames Romberger\nand colored by\nMarguerite Van Cook\n,\nSeven Miles a Second\nis a graphic novel that Wojnarowicz began in 1987, after Romberger and Van Cook closed\nGround Zero Gallery\n. However, the work wasn't finished until 1996, long after Wojnarowicz's death, when it was published by DC/Vertigo. It was subsequently republished in 2013 by Fantagraphics.\nOriginally,\n7 Miles a Second\nwas a collaboration between Romberger and Wojnarowicz. The plan was for the book to tell Wojnarowicz's life story in four parts: his early hustling years in Manhattan, his teenage years on the street, his life as an artist and activist in 1987, and a concluding section meant to show a happy future moment.\n[2]\nHowever, Wojnarowicz had a hard time plotting out the third part, and the fourth part was never written. After Wojnarowicz's death, his partner,\nTom Rauffenbart\ngave Romberger diaries and other material from which to finish the work. Romberger, in turn, brought on Van Cook as the colorist.\n[3]\nMaterial relating to\n7 Miles a Second\ncan be found in the Wojanrowicz collection at the Fales Library, Series III, Subseries A, Container 1, Box 6.\nIn the Shadow of the American Dream\n(2000)\nIn the Shadow of the American Dream\nis a condensed and edited version of Wojnarowicz's journals, edited by\nAmy Scholder\nand published by Grove Press in 2000. The title is taken from an essay contained in\nClose to the Knives\n. It was subsequently re-released, in 2014, by Open Road Media, as part of a series of his books which included republished versions of\nClose to the Knives\n,\nThe Waterfront Journals\n, and\nMemories that Smell Like Gasoline\n.

Acrylic on canvas, 95 x 95 inches. Private collection. Courtesy of the Estate of David Wojnarowicz and\nPPOW\n, New York\nWojnarowicz did not have formal training in painting, although his high school art teacher, Betty Ann Hogan, taught a studio class where he learned how to stretch canvas and mix paints.\n[1]\nAccording to Wojnarowicz, he began producing paintings in 1982 by invitation: “Then some guy…asked me to exhibit in an art gallery. I said ok and bought a couple of Masonite boards. That was really the first bonafide painting I ever did.”\n[2]\nThat guy was Ed Baynard, and he had invited Wojnarowicz to contribute to a group show at\nAlexander F. Milliken Gallery\nin Soho. At that time, Wojnarowicz was primarily known for his graffiti and\nstencil\nwork, and Baynard was taken by the burning house image he’d seen stenciled around the East Village. Wojnarowicz was also already painting at the abandoned warehouses along the\nWest Side Piers\n.  For his contribution to Milliken, Wojnarowicz produced\nUntitled (Green Head)\n, a diptych based off of a photograph of\nPeter Hujar\n’s head, with layered stencils of soldiers, planes, and the burning house.\nWojnarowicz did occasionally paint on canvas or muslin instead of wood, as in\nUntitled (Man with Rifle)\n, from 1983, and\nLate Afternoon in the Forest\n, 1986. But Masonite seemed to have been his preferred material, which he used as an architectural surface on which to create the layered, densely symbolic imagery he pursued in other media. One example, which also demonstrates Wojnarowicz’s collaborative work in painting, is the 1984\nCollaboration with Marion S.\nIn this painting, cut maps, paper money, and a photographic image of the New York City skyline form the ground for painted imagery of rivers and a hand cutting meat. A hinged door is cut out of the Masonite, on which a photograph of\nKiki Smith\nby\nMarion Scemama\naffixed, upside-down, with a wire screen over it.\n[3]\nAfter taking 1985 off from painting following his inclusion in the Whitney Biennial, Wojnarowicz continued to make large-scale, layered works. Two significant groups of works are the ones he exhibited in his 1986\nGracie Mansion Gallery\nsolo show (which\nCynthia Carr\ndescribed as the “history paintings”), and the “Four Elements” paintings, two of which are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. The “history paintings” pair imagery of post-industrial ruin with organic or archaic symbols, and include pre-printed materials like supermarket posters, maps, and paper money, as well painted images of Western landscapes, Native American symbols, and animals. In the “Four Elements” paintings, four 6x8 paintings depict fire, water, earth, and wind, and on the iconography and pre-printed material above, along with skeletons, tornadoes, volcanoes, human organs, and other personal references.\n[4]\nThe incorporation of pre-printed material like maps, music sheets, and paper money is a signature technique. For Wojnarowicz this material held very specific charge: \"I'll use pre-printed material in order to illustrate something of the structure behind those pre-printed materials.\"\n[5]\nMaps in particular symbolized the disciplinary control of what Wojnarowicz described as the “pre-invented world,” and by altering maps, he offered an alternative vision: “By tearing through maps, I erase borders; borders create ownership and wars.”\n[6]\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nPeople\n5\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nHand-written list of paints to buy, c. 1990. Wojnarowicz Papers, Fales, Phone logs, Series 4, Box 7, Folder 10\nWojnarowicz primarily worked with acrylic, enamel, and spray paint. His choice of paint was frequently guided by affordability. In 1984, he explained, \"Until recently I couldn't afford to buy good acrylic paint. The cheapest stuff is Utrecht, which costs $2.99 a bottle, compared to $15 for other brands.\"\n[7]\nIn interviews,\nMarguerite Van Cook\nand\nJames Romberger\necho his attachment to Utrecht paint, and particularly emphasized the use of Utrecht blue. They also note that a recurring green aqua (a water-based, acrylic gloss finish) was used because\nCivilian Warfare\nhad cans left over from painting their storefront and Wojnarowicz used them.\n[8]\nLater in his career, a list from a circa 1989 phone log offers insight into the colors he was using at that time.\nWojnarowicz frequently salvaged Masonite from lumber yards, or from his friends who worked in the theater district.\n[9]\nPieces with precise windows  were cut to his specifications.\nMarion Scemama\nrecalls dropping off instructions for wood to be cut during the Fall and Winter of 1989 and 1990 when she spent considerable time assisting him with his work.\nWendy Olsoff\nalso describes ordering wood to his specifications and delivering it to his home.\n[10]\nIn terms of process, Wojnarowicz planned out his paintings in advance, as can be seen in sketches in Fales [insert image from Series 4, Box 7, Folder 9] He sometimes reworked a painting over time, returning to a piece and adding to it. John Carlin describes the evolution of\nDeath of American Spirituality,\n1987, which began as a sketch from a dream that was then made into a painting in 1985 for a commission in Paris that was not accepted and was returned to in 1987, when Wojnarowicz added the final imagery of rifle targets and a cowboy.\n[11]\nConservation and display\nThese are wall-mounted works. Installation views during his lifetime would likely give indication of Wojnarowicz’s preferred hanging style:\nWendy Olsoff\nrecalled that Wojnarowicz was involved in the installation of his work at\nPPOW\n, though\nSur Rodney Sur\nand Barry Blinderman recalled that Wojnarowicz was not involved in his installations at\nGracie Mansion\nand\nIllinois State University\n, respectively.\n[12]\nSelected works\nLate Afternoon in the Forest\n, 1986.

One action that was realized was at Leo Castelli Gallery in 1980, where they filled the stairwell with cow bones and spray-painted stenciled imagery on the walls. Wojnarowicz’s unauthorized contribution to PS1’s 1982\nBeast: Animal Imagery in Recent Painting\n, in which he released dozens of live \"cockabunnies\" (cockroaches with rabbit ears and tails glued to them), was also retroactively labeled an “action installation.” The common thread amongst these works was their status as political gestures aimed squarely at what Wojnarowicz saw as the hypocrisy of the art world at that time.\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\n5\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nThe\nstencils\nwere made out of cut paper.

Wojnarowicz often worked with partner who could serve as lookout.\n[2]\nFor\nHunger\n, Hair and Wojnarowicz sourced cow bones from a meatpacker on West 14th Street. Wojnarowicz and Hair then shrink-wrapped the bones at the frame shop where Hair was working at that time.

These techniques included the use of found items such as human skeletons or detritus sourced from abandoned lots, as well as unstable materials and provisional structures. Wojnarowicz eagerly used whatever available material would best communicate an idea for the purpose of a temporary installation, creating giant works out of papier-mâché (as in\nAmerica: Heads of Family/Heads of State\n, below), or using a commercial photo-mural adhesive to line the walls and serve as a support for paintings, as he did at his first solo exhibition at\nCivilian Warfare\nAs with his other installation work, he frequently collaborated with friends to source, plan, and realize his ambitious settings.\nConservation and display\nMost of Wojnarowicz's installations were temporary and site-specific, and thus have not been conserved.\nThe\nMnuchin Installation\n) was recreated by\nPPOW Gallery\nat Frieze Art Fair, New York, in May 2016.

Documentary photographs were shown alongside the recreated installation to indicate the items that were missing.

Where elsewhere he painted on supermarket posters or cut and pasted collages of maps and paper money, he turned toward large prints as backgrounds in the late 1980s. In\nSeeds of Industry II\n, 1988-89, multiple layers are built up using photographic techniques: the bottom-most layer of abstract camera-less prints of photochemical spills serve as frames for a grid of square black-and-white prints, on top of which float cut-out ovals of Xeroxed dollar bills and painted image of a monkey that Wojnarowicz had photographed at a circus in Mexico, along with an industrial worker pushing a gear. In\nUntitled (Nest)\n, 1989, Wojnarowicz similarly collaged photographs and painting on a gridded ground. He created tiles of 16 x 20 black-and-white prints of building frames, scaffolding, and palm trees, overlaid with circular insets of other photographic prints, some surrounded by red spray-painted haloes, as well as a large painted nest and a vertical band of painted figures showing a group of people fleeing a fire (the latter was taken from a news photograph taken in Haiti).\nMedia and techniques\nAfter\nPeter Hujar’s\ndeath in November of 1987, Wojnarowicz moved into Hujar’s vacated loft, where he had regular access to a dark room for the first time (see\nphotography\n] for further information). This allowed for a fertile period of experimentation with printing, furnishing a source of raw image material for Wojnarowicz to incorporate into his painting practice.\nSelected works\nReferences\n↑\nLucy Lippard, “Passenger on the Shadows,” in\nBrush Fires in a Social Landscape\n, 2nd ed.

Although he believed language to be limiting - part of the \"pre-invented world\" of ideas he tried to resist through his work - his monologues had a raw, fiery power, and he used the written word in many of his paintings, films, and installations. Throughout his career, he gave lectures and read at a range of locations, including art institutions, activist gatherings, and other venues. His first reading was a poetry reading at Morning Star Arts in Union City, NJ in 1975. Though he later erased this period from his autobiographical accounts\n[1]\n, in the late 1970s he was deeply involved with a small group of mostly New York-based poets including\nJohn Ensslin\n, Dennis DeForge,\nMichael Morais\n, and\nBrian Butterick\n. Through this network, Wojnarowicz read his poems and letters at small poetry readings around New York City, and planned poetry journals and salons throughout the late 1970s.\n[2]\nLater, when he became involved in AIDS activism, his readings were explicitly political. In one example, in 1989, following controversy over NEA funding for a show he was participating in, Wojnarowicz read searing essays exploring his personal and political rage over the AIDS crisis at Artists Space, while wearing a Reagan mask. He also appeared on a local television show to answer questions about the NEA controversy, again wearing the Reagan mask. Later that year he read unmasked at MoMA. For his\nTongues of Flame\nexhibition at Illinois State University\n, when invited to do a reading for an AIDS benefit, Wojnarowicz read from\nClose to the Knives\n, and asked\nPatrick McDonnell\n, a young graduate student, to perform costumed as an abstract cartoon character, painting live on newsprint walls, banging drums, and smashing glass.\nReferences\n↑\nCynthia Carr,\nFire in the Belly: The Life and Times of David Wojnarowicz\n(New York, Bloomsbury, 2012): 67.\n↑\nCarr, 56.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Performance--Lectures_and_Readings&oldid=4088\n\"\nCategories\n:\nWorks\nPerformance\nText\nThis page was last modified on 4 April 2017, at 02:16.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

For instance, he created densely layered performances that combined sound, moving images, and live or rotting elements in his\ninstallation work\n. And in his\n3 Teens Kill 4\nperformances, the band members would spray paint in the background, suggesting a multimedia art piece as much as a performance.\n[1]\nITSOFOMO\nWojnarowicz’s most significant multimedia performance piece was\nITSOFOMO\n(\nIn the Shadow of Forward Motion\n). performed with musician\nBen Neill\n. It was performed at the Kitchen in New York in December 1989, followed by performances at the Center on Contemporary Art in Seattle, the San Francisco Art Institute, Hallwalls in Buffalo, NY, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and Exit Art in New York City. Wojnarowicz spent much of 1989 planning for the performance, collecting photographs, sounds, and film clips, and working with Neill to choreograph the show. Everything was potential material, including an answering machine tape from his estranged brother and an improvised film he shot of\nMarion Scemama\nviolently tussling with her boyfriend during their retreat upstate (neither of which ended up in the final show).\n[2]\nThe title is short for “In the Shadow of Forward Motion” (also the title of a 1989 exhibition at\nP·P·O·W\n, and the\nXeroxed catalogue\nproduced for that show). Wojnarowicz explained the feeling he wanted to capture thusly: \"Consider that you're in a car speeding along on an expressway. Everything that you see out of the corner of your eye which doesn't register [while you're] in the pursuit of speed... It’s all the things quietly occurring, within absence of sight.”\n[3]\nFor Wojnarowicz, trains symbolized this relentless, destructive acceleration, as they had enabled western expansion in the United States and the simultaneous destruction of Native American culture. Neill believed that his fascination with this concept at this point in Wojnarowicz's life also had to do with the accelerating progress of his own AIDS-related illness.\n[4]\nThe performance constituted an assault on what Wojnarowicz called the ”One-Tribe-Nation,” or the disciplinary constructs propagated by the government and the media that govern society. The performance was structured around the idea of acceleration. He used visual metaphors of life and death, symbols of industry and nature. The piece was a mix of improvised and scripted components, recycled video, slide projections, sculpture, live dance, reading, and live musical composition to create an immersive environment.\nExcerpts from the video footage and audio used in the performance can be found on Ben Neill's YouTube page:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPf8gHJ13Do\nMedia and Techniques\nWojnarowicz used nearly every media he worked with elsewhere in his practice in\nITSOFOMO\n. The final work performed at the Kitchen was a multimedia performance with four monitors simultaneously showing videos, two screens for slide projections, live dancers, and other performers who read texts and moved papier-mache objects around the stage (dancers did not appear in the subsequent iterations of the piece). Many of the slides and videos were pulled from Wojnarowicz’s photographs and films, including\nThe Weight of the Earth\n,\nFear of Evolution\n, and\nFire in My Belly\n. Neill added a live soundtrack of sampled sounds such as recorded bells, trombones, and yelling, in addition to other percussion and electronic sounds. They received grants for a recording of the performance, and discussed creating a video documentary that would intersperse Wojnarowicz’s video with performance and rehearsal footage. A DVD was released in 2004.\nExtensive documentation of Wojnarowicz’s planning for\nITSOFOMO\ncan be found throughout the Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales. Slides with performance notes that were likely used for\nITSOFOMO\ncan be found in Series IX, Subseries F, Box 84. Notes and sketches can be found throughout the phone logs (Series IV, Box 7, Folders 1-29).

Wojnarowicz started this series in the summer of 1978.\nBrian Butterick\nand\nJohn Hall\nserved as models, posing around New York wearing a photostatted mask of Arthur Rimbaud’s face taken from the cover of Rimbaud's\nIlluminations\n.  The resulting work was first exhibited as a series in 1990, when he reprinted the work for the exhibition\nIn The Garden\nat\nP·P·O·W\n. When the exhibition went up, he explained to David Hirsch at\nThe New York Native\nthat:\nI felt, at that time, that I wanted it to be the last thing I did before I ended up back on the streets or died or disappeared. Over the years, I've periodically found myself in situations that felt desperate and, in those moments, I'd feel that I needed to make certain things... I had Rimbaud come through a vague biographical outline of what my past had been -- the places I had hung out in as a kid, the places I starved in or haunted on some level.\n[1]\nApart from\nArthur Rimbaud in New York\n, Wojnarowicz did not exhibit fully photographic work until after\nPeter Hujar\nhad passed away. Hujar's death itself was the subject of a powerful series. Moments after Hujar died, Wojnarowicz asked gathered friends to leave the room, and he shot Super-8mm film and exactly 23 photographs of Hujar’s body (he labeled the envelope of contact sheets “23 photos of Peter, 23 genes in a chromosome, Room 1423”\n[2]\nHe printed these works as individual prints, incorporated them into a powerful photo-text-painting collage titled\nUntitled (Hujar Dead)\n, 1988-89, and exhibited his head, hands, and feet together in a triptych titled \"Untitled (Peter Hujar)\", 1989.\nIn 1988, Wojnarowicz moved into Hujar’s loft. With new access to a dark room, and the encouragement of\nGary Schneider\nand\nJohn Erdman\n(friends and long time photo printers for Hujar), Wojnarowicz began to go back over years of negatives and experiment in the dark room. His photographic subjects included anything that struck him as an impactful image, and included friends, animals, nature, architecture, landscapes and people from his travels, and symbols of industrial power. One of his best known photographs is\nUntitled (Buffalos)\n, 1988-89.  Shot at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., this image appears to catch a herd of buffaloes mid-fall as they tumble from a cliff; it was taken of a diorama meant to illustrate a Native American method for hunting buffalo by driving them towards unfamiliar terrain. The photo was used by the band U2 as the cover for their release of the single \"One\" as a benefit for AIDS.\n[3]\nIn addition to printing individual images, Wojnarowicz would install multiple prints together, either by combining multiple prints on a single large sheet, or by creating multi-part works on a single wall. In works like these, a series of images would be used to make a specific argument. As he frequently noted, Wojnarowicz thought of an individual photographic image as a word that could be combined with others in a process akin to writing:  “I generally will place many photographs together or print them one inside the other in order to construct a free-floating sentence that speaks about the world I witness.”\n[4]\nFor example, in\nSilence Through Economics\n, 1988-89, five images mounted on museum board are, clockwise: an image of a newborn baby in the hospital, an image of a loaf of bread being sewn together, an image of a man’s lips being sewn together, bandaged hands holding coins, and a solider patrolling a park. In these images, the natural and unsullied (the park, the newborn) clashes with disciplinary regimes (military, medical), and these images are connected with violence, money, food, and silence.\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nEarly on, Wojnarowicz had some of his own printing experience (he printed some of the 1978 Arthur Rimbaud in New York series himself, for instance), but also printed at commercial labs. He had occasional access to darkroom facilities throughout the early-mid 1980s—\nTommy Turner\nhad a darkroom he would use. But when Wojnarowicz moved into\nHujar\n’s loft at 2nd Avenue and 12th Street following his death in November 1987, he had access to a dark room for the time. The darkroom had been remodeled while Hujar was sick, so when Wojnarowicz moved in it was barely used.\n[5]\nHujar had also left behind stacks of Portriga Rapid paper, which produced a rich tonal range. Wojnarowicz prized this paper for the photographic quality as well as the connection to Hujar.\n[6]\nBecause the darkroom only had equipment for developing prints up to 16 x 20 inches, Wojnarowicz printed everything larger with friend Schneider and Erdman. Wojnarowicz offered Schneider little direction, and never provided match prints (as most artists seeking enlargements would do). Some 20x24 prints by Wojnarowicz exist, but he would have had made them by carefully rocking the paper in the smaller 16x20 to ensure even application of developer. Color prints—including two Cibachrome prints he produced while working on\nTongues of Flame\nin Normal, IL--he would have had to develop at a color lab.\nDespite his consistent use of photography, Wojnarowicz frequently insisted he was not a photographer. He wrote about the irony of being described as a “visiting photographer” in an invited lecture by noting, “I don’t even know how to operate a camera on anything other than an automatic.”\n[7]\nHe used many cameras, and often would borrow from friends.\nHujar\nhad tried to teach him how to use his Leica, but Wojnarowicz didn’t like working with the f-stops and manual settings.\n[8]\nTom Rauffenbart\nrecalls his favorite was a simple Pentax SLR set up for semiautomatic exposures, equipped with close up lens.\n[9]\nWojnarowicz printed many negatives, and explored the potential configurations for multi-photograph works in his studio.\n[10]\nOnce he had a final arrangement, Wojnarowicz precisely cropped the prints, arranged them in grid-like patterns, and mounted them on museum board to be framed together.\nConservation and display\nSelected works\nReferences\n↑\nAs quoted in Carr, Cynthia.

One of the first examples of Wojnarowicz using his own text as a primary component in his work was a multimedia piece he contributed to\nStill Trauma\nat the Milford Gallery in 1988, which was called\nUntitled (Hujar Dead)\n. In this work, silkscreened photographs of\nPeter Hujar\non his deathbed are layered on top of a frame of abstracted supermarket posters and currency. On top of the photographs, a searing text captures his rage and frustration with the government and medical community’s handling of the AIDS crisis. It was this work that led to his contract with Random House to produce\nClose to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration\n.\n[1]\nLater, he produced a series of work comprised of simple pairings of a single photographic image and a specifically chosen text written by him. Some of this work was included in his\nPPOW\nexhibition\nIn the Garden\n. The centerpiece of the show was a series of paintings he had created while in Normal, IL for\nTongues of Flame\n, which featured photorealistic flowers layered with small text that drew the viewer in. Surrounding this work was a series photographic pieces in which he paired one of his with photographs with montaged text. In\nWhat is this little guy’s job in the world\n, 1990, a photograph of his own hand holding a tiny frog is paired with text that he first composed as a spontaneous monologue while being filmed by\nMarion Scemama\n. The monologue included the words: “What is this little guy’s job in the work. If this little guy dies, does the world know?...Does an almost imperceptible link in the chain snap?”\n[2]\nOne of the last series, which Wojnarowicz planned but did not complete, was a trio of large photographs paired with text. The first of these,\nWhen I Put My Hands On Your Body\n, paired an image he took in Illinois of a Native American burial ground, which showed partly exhumed skeletons, with a loving and melancholic text: “When I put my hands on your body on your flesh I feel the history of that body…If I could attach our blood vessels in order to anchor you to the earth to this present time to me I would.” The second completed work featured a photograph of bandaged hands with text that meditates on mortality: “Sometimes I come to hate people because they can’t see where I am…I can no longer find what I’m looking for outside myself…I am disappearing but not fast enough.” For the third piece, he had selected an image of a burning temple, but had not decided on the text.\n[3]\nAccording to artist\nKiki Smith\n, Wojnarowicz’s work with photography and text is her favorite: “I really think his strength lies in his writing and in the combination of the writing with the photographic images.”\n[4]\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nTest prints in Fales archives demonstrate that Wojnarowicz was experimenting in the darkroom in order to achieve the effect he wanted with text collages. Works like\nWhat is this little guy's job…\nwere created (most likely) by having a transparent cel of text created by a commercial printer, and then placing it over an exposure in the dark room.\n[5]\nThe print would have to be carefully developed in order to minimize the edges of the cel. Wojnarowicz could then create a new copy negative by photographing the best print.\nFor works like\nWhen I Put My Hands On Your Body\n, text was professionally silkscreened onto a large print after the fact.\nGary Schneider\nproduced the large prints, and worked carefully with Wojnarowicz to consider questions of scale and balance with the text.\nConservation and display\nSelected works\nWhen I Put My Hands On Your Body\n, 1990, Gelatin silver print with silkscreened text, 34 x 46 inches.

This can be achieved by physically cutting and pasting prints, then rephotographing to create a new negative, or by printing multiple negative on a single sheet.\nHis most significant and technically complex series of photomontages are those that comprise the\nSex Series\n. In these eight photomontages, Wojnarowicz lays circular insets of found porn, clipped articles, and other images onto urban, industrial, and natural landscapes. In one of the simpler works, an image of a house and water tower is interrupted by a circular inset of two men engaging in oral sex. The images have an eerie quality to them, like slightly off negative images, which was achieved via a specific process (outlined below). Wojnarowicz has written that he was inspired after he had been rejected from an exhibition in Paris about sexuality when the curator told him it was not a show about AIDS; he felt “effectively silenced.”\n[1]\nFurther, the combination of images extended his ability to “write” with images; he wrote that the images in the Sex Series “came out of writing and worked their way into photography.”\n[2]\nLucy Lippard\nhas written about the connection between the circular format and images of surveillance or observations under a microscope.\n[3]\nFinally, he explained to\nCynthia Carr\nthat the series “came out of loss. I mean every time I opened a magazine there was a face of somebody else who died…And it essentially came out of wanting some sexy images on the wall—for me. To keep me company.”\n[4]\nThe works were exhibited with the subtitle “(for Marion Scemama).” Wojnarowicz has written that this was partly a joke, partly in recognition of the creative support she offered at the time he made the series; Scemama was visiting from Paris regularly and assisting him in the studio. <Carr, 412.</ref>\nThe series became embroiled in Wojnarowicz’s legal battles when four prints were included in the Artists’ Space show Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing [hyperlink], and when they were included in the exhibition and catalogue for\nTongues of Flame\nat\nIllinois State University\n. The NEA, who funded the Illinois exhibition, and had initially funded the Artists Space exhibition, asked Artists Space to relinquish the grant after viewing art in the show. In the press that followed the controversy, the Sex Series was conflated with Wojnarowicz’s essay contribution suggesting he illustrated text about a corrupt Catholic Cardinal with “homosexual acts”.\n[5]\nCropped images of sex acts from the Sex Series were also included in Reverend Wildmon’s 1990 letter to Congress with the title “Your Tax Dollars Paid for This” expressing outrage over the Illinois exhibition.\n[6]\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nThe\nSex Series\nare among Wojnarowicz’s most technically complex work, and show his skill and commitment to work in the darkroom.\nMarguerite van Cook\nhad told Wojnarowicz about an effect she had discovered enlarging color slides on black-and-white paper: the result looked like a negative but a bit off. She also told him about burning a circular image into the paper by removing the negative holder from a circular enlarger.\n[7]\nHe used both for the\nSex Series\n. Beyond these non-traditional techniques, Wojnarowicz would have also had to cut a series of precisely measured masks: in order to print a single circular inset image on the same paper as the background image he would have needed a mask for the background, a mask for the circular inset, and one for the border.\n[8]\nOnce Wojnarowicz had one set of unique prints, he brought the series to\nGary Schneider\nto make enlargements.\n[9]\nConservation and display\nThe\nSex Series\nwas framed by Stefen Petrik in custom red frames.

For\nITSOFOMO\n, he used papier-mâché to create a large egg and sperm sculpture, and he created a wolf's mask out of an issue of the New York Times. He also created a skeleton costume with a large penis, a monstrous head, and a googly-eyed face attached to the ribcage, which he used for a photo series he shot in 1990 in Normal, IL featuring\nPatrick McDonnell\nas a model. The shoot resulted in the photographs\nDeath in the Forest\nand\nDeath in a Cornfield.\nIn addition to objects he made or altered, Wojnarowicz also frequently used found or purchased objects as props. For his early installation work, he gathered urban detritus from around the city (for example in the\nMnuchin installation\n). During a trip to Teotihuacan in 1986, he brought along a series of props that he filmed covered in fire ants: a crucifix, a toy soldier, watches, and coins. Some of this footage appears in\nFire in My Belly (a work in progress)\n. This imagery also appears in photographs from the\nAnt Series\n, such as\nUntitled from the Ant Series (control)\n, 1988-89, which shows a toy soldier covered in ants.\nSome objects in Wojnarpwicz's practice escape the typical definitions of a sculpture,  prop, source material, or installation component. Wojnarowicz acquired real human and animal skeletons in Paris in 1985, some of which may have been included in installations like\nYou Killed Me First\n(1985),\nInstallation #5\n(1985), and\nAmerica: Heads of Family/Heads of State\n(1990). At least one of these, a child skeleton, Wojnarowicz kept in a handmade coffin with a specific objects arranged inside.\n[1]\nMany other objects in the Wojnarowicz Papers, catalogued in Series XIII: Objects and Artifacts, also defy definition—as just two examples, there is a taxidermied alligator and a Muppets doll with a drum tied around its neck and a button that reads “I am the public,” neither of which are readily identified as being part of exhibited works.\nOne particularly poignant example is a baby elephant skeleton purchased in 1985 that Wojnarowicz kept with him until the time of his death, discussed further below.\nContents\n1\nBaby elephant skeleton\n2\nMedia and techniques\n3\nImages\n4\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\n5\nReferences\nBaby elephant skeleton\nAmong the skeletons Wojnarowicz purchased in Paris in 1985 was a skeleton of a baby elephant. With the others, this was shipped to\nKeith Davis\n’ apartment until he could pick it up. For the rest of his life, Wojnarowicz kept this skeleton with him, often displayed prominently in his home.\nTom Rauffenbart\nrecalled his apartment at 529 East Thirteenth Street, where he moved in 1987 contained a cluttered by spare set of items: “a couple of hard back chairs, a futon on the floor, paint, clutter, and a baby elephant skeleton”\n[2]\nJames Romberger\nrecalled that in 1988, Wojnarowicz made him sit down next to the baby elephant skeleton in his apartment to watch an early cut of\nFire in My Belly\n. In\nNan Goldin’s\n1991 portrait,\nDavid Wojnarowicz at Home, New York City\n, the head of the elephant noses in from the left. In 1992, while he was ill, Wojnarowicz asked\nKaren Finley\nto take the elephant skeleton, Finley believes, to ensure its safe keeping. Finley noted “I always saw it as an image really of him, of his totem. He’s an elephant. The elephant never forgets. You know—there’s the ancientness of it.”\n[3]\nMedia and techniques\nAs in other areas of his practice, Wojnarowicz favored the use of readily available materials.

The next time he took up a journal was in 1976 on a road trip bound for California. He picked it up again 1977, and kept journals consistently (with some breaks) for the rest of his life. Wojnarowicz used his journals to keep recollections of his travels, the people he met, his own reactions to new experiences, and (increasingly throughout his life) his vivid dreams. He also used these journals to plan out artwork, sometimes through sketching and direct contemplation of new work, sometimes because an old story would make its way into a new image. He would also draft essays in the journals or use passages from the journals in published essays.

Alongside four untitled poems, Wojnarowicz published several interior illustrations, and his pen-and-ink drawing of Seaport Diner graced the cover. Wojnarowicz also illustrated his last book,\nMemories that Smell Like Gasoline\n, with delicate drawings and watercolors illustrating sexual encounters.\nWojnarowicz also drew extensively in his journals and phone logs, adding imagery from his travels or from his dreams, creating playful doodles, and sketching out paintings, installations, and film work. Early on in his career, Wojnarowicz developed his drawing practice with the hope of showing the work in galleries. He drew a series of landscapes and dreamscapes while he was in Paris in 1978, and a series of factories and portraits in 1980 in New York. He discussed with other artists and friends his intent to show these to galleries. Yet although drawing was an essential and continuous activity for Wojnarowicz throughout his life, aside from juvenilia, sketches, and illustrations that accompanied his published writings, Wojnarowicz did not exhibit drawings on paper once he started regularly showing in galleries in the 1980s.\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\n5\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nWojnarowicz used felt-tip markers, watercolor, pen-and-ink, and graphite pencil.\nConservation and display\nIn his sketches, Wojnarowicz paid little attention to the archival quality of paper.

Hand-colored Xerox, 35 x 47 1⁄2 inches. Courtesy of the Estate of David Wojnarowicz and P.P.O.W, New York\nXerox machines were a commercially available tool that Wojnarowicz used in the planning and execution of a variety of work. Wojnarowicz frequently collected found material to incorporate into his work—from newspaper clippings to play money and comic strips—and he used Xeroxes to transfer and manipulate images. He also used Xeroxes to manipulate photographic images, as he did in the preparations for the Photostat print\nOne Day This Kid\n, detailed in the case study section.\nUntitled (Genet after Brassai)\n, 1979, is one notable early Xerox collage. In this work, Jean Genet is inserted within Christian iconography of martyrdom, pictured with a halo in a church setting, with an icon of Christ shooting up with a syringe in the background. The process of producing the work was recorded in his journals. In a 1979 journal entry he noted, “Do a Saint Genet collage—go to Strand for a copy of his photo on Funeral Rites.”\n[1]\nWojnarowicz used Xerox as a component in sculptures like\nBrain Time/Blood Time\n1988-89, and as support in\nUntitled\n, 1989-90.

The exhibition featured a 4.16 minute film, credited as “A Fire In My Belly” by the artist David Wojnarowicz. However, Wojnarowicz never publicly displayed\nA Fire In My Belly\nin a finished form, and the version shown at the Smithsonian was created specifically for\nHide/Seek\nby Katz and the artist\nBart Everly\n, with permission from the Wojnarowicz estate.\nThis edit was created from footage found on a Super 8mm reel of film acquired by the Fales Library and Special Collections in 2000, which was labeled (by Wojnarowicz himself) “Mexico, etc... Peter, etc…For Michael Lupetin.”\nMexico, etc...\nwas created by Wojnarowicz and a collaborator (Marion Scemama) specifically for use in Rosa von Praunheim’s 1990 documentary\nSilence=Death,\nwhich was about artists and AIDS.\nMichael Lupetin\nwas the producer on that project.\nHowever, the footage on\nMexico, etc…\ncorrelates closely to another reel of Super 8mm film and a shooting script also held in the Wojnarowicz Papers, both of which were labeled “A Fire In My Belly” by Wojnarowicz. According to a timeline written for the catalog of his 1990 show\nTongues of Flame,\nWojnarowicz considered\nA Fire In My Belly\nunfinished, writing that he “went through 2 versions then disassembled for other projects.”\n[1]\nThe version shown in\nHide/Seek\nfeatured at least one frame from every individual shot in “Mexico, etc…” although not in the same order as they were presented in the original.\nThe film shown in\nHide/Seek\nused an audio recording from the Wojnarowicz Papers at the Fales Library as a soundtrack, which was recorded at a 1989 ACT UP demonstration attended by Wojnarowicz.\nIn the National Portrait Gallery, this film was placed in a room dedicated to AIDS-related artwork. The film was installed on a touch screen, which required visitors to activate it specifically.\nCuratorial Intentions\nJonathan David Katz stated that he wanted to show Wojnarowicz’s film work, but none of his films were under four minutes, the limit imposed by the National Portrait Gallery. However, he felt that there was precedent for re-editing the raw footage on\nMexico, etc…\nsince it had been used in\nSilence=Death.\nKatz’s goal was to make a version of\nA Fire In My Belly\nthat was explicitly about AIDS; however, he also believed that the original film, as created by Wojnarowicz, was about the AIDS crisis. He stated that “[\nA Fire In My Belly\n] is about AIDS, but its metaphorical relationship to AIDS is so fine that it doesn’t even get noticed.”\n[2]\nEleven Controversial Seconds\nThe controversy over\nA Fire In My Belly\ncentered around eleven seconds of footage of ants crawling over a crucifix, an image that Wojnarowicz had recorded in 1986 during a trip to Mexico. This begins at the two minute mark in\nBart Everly’s website\n.\nWojnarowicz frequently used ants in his work. During the filming session for this segment of\nA Fire In My Belly,\nhe also recorded ants walking on a clock face, toy soldiers, coins, and other everyday objects. In a 1989 interview, he stated that\nAnimals allow us to view certain things that we wouldn't allow ourselves to see in regard to human activity. In the Mexican photographs with the coins and the clock and the gun and the Christ figure and all that, I used the ants as a metaphor for society because the social structure of the ant world is parallel to ours.\nAccording to his biographer, Cynthia Carr, Wojnarowicz’s use of ants represented “humanity rushing along, heedless of what lies under its tiny feet, indifferent to the structures that surround it.”\n[3]\nTimeline of the Controversy\nNovember 29th – The Controversy Begins\nNB: Unless otherwise specified, all references to A Fire In My Belly below refer to the version created by Jonathan David Katz and Bart Everly for the Hide/Seek exhibit.\nOn November 29th, one month after\nHide/Seek\nopened, the Christian News Service published an article by Penny Starr entitled\n“Smithsonian Christmas-Season Exhibit Features Ant-Covered Jesus, Naked Brothers Kissing, Genitalia, and Ellen DeGeneres Grabbing Her Breasts.”\n[4]\nThe Christian News Service is a division of the Media Research Center, a conservative organization whose mission is to “prove—through sound scientific research—that liberal bias in the media does exist and undermines traditional American values.”\n[5]\nA photo of the film in the exhibition, taken by Starr, was included at the top of the article, with the caption “A crucifix in the video\nA Fire in My Belly,\npart of the ‘'Hide/Seek'’ exhibit at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery. The image shows Christ on the cross with ants crawling over his body and face.”\nThe article went on to describe the piece and Wojnarowicz at length, saying:\n“A Fire in My Belly” was created by David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992). The full-length version of this 1987 video, according to the description at the exhibit, is 30 minutes long. The version viewable in the National Portrait Gallery has been edited down to 4 minutes. The description says, “\nA Fire in My Belly,\na compilation of footage largely shot in Mexico, weaves together numerous images of loss, pain, and death into a metaphor for the AIDS epidemic; it concludes in a picture of the world aflame.”\nThe description speaks of the video artist's \"poetic, yet furious, condemnation of the way greed, religion, and selfishness conspire to label certain people as outside the scope of our caring.\" It also quotes Wojnarowicz, who died of AIDS, as saying, “When I was told I’d contracted the virus, it didn’t take long for me to realize that I’d contracted a diseased society as well.”\nThe four-minute version of the video shown in the exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery shows, among other images, ants crawling over the image of Jesus on a crucifix, two halves of a loaf of bread being sewn together, the bloody mouth of a man being sewn shut, a hand dropping coins, a man undressing, a man's genitals, a bowl of blood, and mummified humans.\nA differently edited four-minute version of Wojnarowicz’s “A Fire in My Belly”\nvideo posted on YouTube\nshows images of ants crawling over the image of Jesus (as does the version exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery), but also shows a man masturbating (an image which is not included in the edited version exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery, which only shows a man's genitals.). The YouTube version also carries a soundtrack that is different from the version exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery.\nWojnarowicz’s collected papers and work are held by the\nFales Library and Special Collections\nin New York City. CNSNews.com contacted the library to verify the authenticity of the edited version of the\n\"A Fire in My Belly\" video posted on YouTube\n. Marvin J. Taylor, the director at the library, told CNSNews.com that the edited YouTube version of the video “is accurate in that it is part of Fire in My Belly. David [Wojnarowicz] had a cutting script for the film that includes these scenes, plus others. The score by Diamanda [on the YouTube version of the video] is not original.”\nBrent Phillips, the media specialist and processing archivist at the Fales Library and Special Collections, said the library supplied the \"moving image material\" for the video to the National Portrait Gallery, but added that he has \"not seen the 'edit' that is currently part of the exhibit.\" The soundtrack for the video in the exhibit \"came from an audiocassette in the David Wojnarowicz Papers here at Fales\" and \"is of an ACT-UP demonstration from June 1989,\" said Phillips in an e-mail to CNSNews.com. \"The sound was added for the exhibit, but as stated, we have not seen the combined edit.\"\nNational Portrait Gallery historian and exhibit co-curator David C. Ward told CNSNews.com in an e-mail that “A Fire in My Belly” reflects the “violent, disturbing and hallucinatory” aspects of the AIDS epidemic.\n“Fire in My Belly is an example of political engagement in artistic form with the AIDS epidemic by an artist deeply concerned with the exploration of our response to that medical and societal calamity,” Ward said. “That it is violent, disturbing, and hallucinatory precisely replicates the impact of the disease itself on people and a society that could barely comprehend its magnitude.”\n“The museum was careful to edit the video for a museum audience,” Ward said. “It is a 4-minute sample of a much longer work and the curators and the museum were aware of our responsibility in introducing a difficult piece of work about an important subject in a way that respects the individual sensibilities of our public.”\nA portrait of the video’s creator David Wojnarowicz, buried up to his face, is also in the exhibit. The catalog description says of the image: “Here, on the brink of a premature death, Wojnarowicz is at once disappearing peacefully into the American landscape and being violently suffocated by it.”\nThe Smithsonian-published catalog also notes (p. 54) that “Wojnarowicz earned a reputation for public, and for many, an utterly cathartic, portrait of rage.” It then quotes a passage from Wojnarowicz’s 1991 book, Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration, in which the artist writes of daydreaming about shooting darts dipped in HIV-positive blood into the necks of politicians and expresses his enmity for “walking swastikas that wear religious garments.”\n“… and I’m waking up more and more from daydreams of tipping Amazonian blowdarts in ‘infected blood’ and spitting them at the exposed necklines of certain politicians or government healthcare officials or those thinly disguised walking swastikas that wear religious garments over their murderous intentions,” the Smithsonian catalog (p. 54) quotes Wojnarowicz as writing.\nNovember 30th – The Catholic League Issues A Call to Action\nWithin twenty-four hours, The Catholic League – a powerful, conservative pro-Catholic organization – issued a press release that described the film as showing “large ants eating away at Jesus on a crucifix.”\n[6]\nThe press release acknowledged the scholarly understanding that the ants were not intended as a blasphemous image, stating:\nLike others who have attacked Christians before with their “art,” [David Ward, co-curator of Hide/Seek] says the ants crawling all over Jesus represent “the lack of attention to Christian teachings.” So the ants are actually giving Christians a wake-up call! How thoughtful.\nThe press release ended by stating:\nIt does not matter that private sources funded this exhibition: the majority of the money afforded the Smithsonian Institution comes from the taxpayers. Accordingly, I am writing today to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees asking them to reconsider future funding.\nNumerous politicians (primarily Republicans), condemned the work, Wojnarowicz, the entire exhibit, and the Smithsonian as a whole, with phrases taken directly from The Catholic League and The Christian News Service. \nGeorgia Representative Jack Kingston said on Fox News that:\nIf they’ve got money to squander like this – of a crucifix being eaten by ants, of Ellen DeGeneres grabbing her breasts, men in chains, naked brothers kissing – then I think we should look at their budget.\nAs a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he went on to advocate “calling them [the Smithsonian] up in front of the Appropriations Committee, asking for some resignations, auditing all their budget — all their books.”\n[7]\nShortly after the Catholic League issued their press release, House-Majority-Leader-Elect Eric Cantor issued a statement saying:\nWhen a museum receives taxpayer money, the taxpayers have a right to expect that the museum will uphold common standards of decency. The museum should pull the exhibit and be prepared for serious questions come budget time.\nCantor also called the film an “outrageous use of taxpayer money and an obvious attempt to offend Christians during the Christmas season.\"\n[8]\nIncoming House Speaker John Boener also weighed in, stating that:\nAmerican families have a right to expect better from recipients of taxpayer funds in a tough economy… Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves to end the job-killing spending spree in Washington.\n[8]\nBy the end of the day, the Secretary of the Smithsonian, G. Wayne Clough, had pulled the film from the exhibition, without consulting the curators or the National Portrait Gallery.\nDecember 1st – Counter Protests Begin\nOn December 1st, also known as World AIDS Day, Transformer Gallery in DC placed a monitor playing A Fire In My Belly in their street facing windows, to protest its removal from\nHide/Seek.\nThey also announced plans for a silent march from Transformer Gallery to the National Portrait Gallery on the evening of December 2nd.\nPPOW Gallery\n, which represents the Wojnarowicz estate, made two versions of A Fire In My Belly viewable on its website: the entire seven-minute reel labeled “Mexico, etc…” that Katz had used as source material, and a thirteen-minute Super 8mm reel of related footage, also contained in the Wojnarowicz archive at the Fales Library and Special Collections, which Wojnarowicz himself had labeled “A Fire In My Belly.” They also made DVDs of these works available to any institution that wanted to show them.\nPPOW Gallery also issued an Official Statement on the controversy, which read:\nPPOW and The Estate of David Wojnarowicz disagree with the Smithsonian's decision to withdraw the artist's 1987 film piece \"A Fire in My Belly\" from the National Portrait Gallery's exhibition entitled \"Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture.\" PPOW has represented Wojnarowicz's work since 1988 and maintained a close working relationship with the artist until his death in 1992. The gallery now represents his estate.\nOn behalf of the estate, the gallery would like to offer the artist's words to illuminate his original intentions. In a 1989 interview Wojnarowicz spoke about the role of animals as symbolic imagery in his work, stating, \"Animals allow us to view certain things that we wouldn't allow ourselves to see in regard to human activity. In the Mexican photographs with the coins and the clock and the gun and the Christ figure and all that, I used the ants as a metaphor for society because the social structure of the ant world is parallel to ours.\"\nThe call for the removal of \"A Fire in My Belly\" by Catholic League president William Donahue is based on his misinterpretation that this work was \"hate speech pure and simple.\" This statement insults the legacy of Wojnarowicz, who dedicated his life to activism and the arts community. David Wojnarowicz's work is collected by international museums including the Museum of Modern Art, NY, The Whitney Museum, The Library of Congress, The New York Public Library, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Reina Sofia in Madrid, Museum Ludwig in Cologne, the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, etc. Wojnarowicz is also an established writer; his most well known memoirs are Close to the Knives and Memories That Smell Like Gasoline, which are included on many university syllabi.\nIn 1990 the artist won a historic Supreme Court case, David Wojnarowicz v. American Family Association. The courts sided with Wojnarowicz after he filed suit against Donald Wildmon and the American Family Association, who copied, distorted and disseminated the artist's images in a pamphlet to speak out against the NEA's funding of exhibits that included art works of Wojnarowicz and other artists. We are deeply troubled that the remarks, which led to the removal of David's work from Hide/Seek, so closely resemble those of the past. Wojnarowicz's fight for freedom of artistic expression, once supported by the highest court, is now challenged again. In his absence, we know that his community, his supporters, and the many who believe in his work will carry his convictions forward.\n[9]\nDecember 2nd – The Protests Spread\nOver 100 people marched from the Transformer Gallery to the National Portrait Gallery with their mouths symbolically taped shut. The gallery also issued a letter to the Smithsonian, calling on them to reinstate the work.\n[10]\nJulia Haas and Alison Maurer, both former students of Jonathan David Katz at Smith College, created the website HideSeek.org, which featured both films put online by PPOW Gallery.\n[11]\nThey also began contacting museums and galleries around the country, asking them to host screenings, and created a list of institutions screening the film worldwide.\nDecember 3rd – The Association of Art Museum Directors Weighs In\nIn a press release (since removed from their website), the Association of Art Museum Directors strongly rebuked the Smithsonian for their decision. In part, the statement read:\nMore disturbing than the Smithsonian’s decision to remove this work of art is the cause: unwarranted and uninformed censorship from politicians and other public figures, many of whom, by their own admission, have seen neither the exhibition as a whole or this specific work.\nThe AAMD believes that freedom of expression is essential to the health and welfare of our communities and our nation. In this case, that takes the form of the rights and opportunities of art museums to present works of art that express different points of view.\n[12]\nDecember 4th – Protests Inside the Smithsonian\nOn December 4th, Michael Blasenstein and Michael Dax Iacovone were arrested inside the National Portrait Gallery, for handing out leaflets about the controversy while wearing iPads hung around their necks that were playing\nA Fire In My Belly\n. Both were originally banned from returning to the Smithsonian for life, though those bans were later removed.\n[13]\nDecember 6th & 7th – The Smithsonian Responds\nOn December 6th, the Smithsonian issued a short statement of support for the exhibit as a whole. In it, they referred to “A Fire In My Belly” as “a four-minute video created as a complex metaphor for AIDS.” However, they stood behind their decision to remove the piece from the show, as the “attention it was receiving distracted from the overall exhibition.”\n[14]\nOn December 7th, the Smithsonian released a longer Q&A regarding the exhibit, the protests, and the counter protests.\n[15]\nFurther Showings & Protests\nMany institutions around the country arranged screenings and protests in solidarity. There is no complete list of all the institutions that participated, however, it is known that the following institutions screened A Fire In My Belly in some form:\n[16]\nAlabama\nSpace One Eleven\n(Birmingham)\nArizona\nSanta Fe Art Institute\nTucson Artist & Musician’s Healthcare Association – ‘The Great Cover Up’ Event\nCasa Libre en la Solana\nCalifornia\nYerba Buena Center for the Arts (SF)\nSF Camerawork (SF)\nSF MOMA\nFivepoints Arthouse (SF)\nSouthern Exposure (SF)\nUniversity of San Francisco (SF)\nStanford Art Department (Palo Alto)\nUAG Gallery at the University of California, Irvine (Irvine)\nUniversity of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (Berkeley)\nLos Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LA)\nREDCAT Gallery (LA)\nWorkspace (LA)\nCB1 Gallery (LA)\nHammer Museum (LA)\nDowntown LA Art Walk (LA)\nOtis College of Art and Design (LA)\nGallery km (LA)\nYoung Project (LA)\nClaremont Graduate University Art Dpt (Claremont)\nGualala Art Center (Gualala)\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (La Jolla)\nConnecticut\nReal Art Ways (Hartford)\nWadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art (Hartford)\nAldrich Museum (Ridgefield)\nIowa\nPublic Space One (Iowa City)\nGeorgia\nEmory University (Atlanta)\nIllinois\nNightingale Theater (Chicago)\nSchool of the Art Institute of Chicago\nUniversity of Chicago’s Smart Museum of Art\nIceberg Projects (Chicago)\nColombia College, Chicago Library\nIndiana\nIndianapolis Museum of Art\nHeron School of Art and Design IUPUI (Indianapolis)\nLouisiana\nNew Orleans Museum of Art, New Orleans\nMassachusetts\nInstitute of Contemporary Art (Boston)\nThe Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University (Waltham)\nMaine\nSPACE Gallery (Portland)\nMichigan\nUniversity of Michigan’s School of Art and Design\nMinnesota\nWalker Art Center (Minneapolis)\nNew Jersey\nGallery Aferro\nNew Mexico\nSante Fe Institute of Art\nNew York\nGeorge Eastman House (Rochester)\nLight Work (Syracuse)\nNorth Carolina\nQueer Explorers Club (Greensboro)\nThe Pinhook (Durham)\nAckland Art Museum (Chapel Hill)\nWeatherspoon Art Museum (Greensboro)\nOhio\nWexner Center for the Arts (Colombus)\nWright State University (Dayton)\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Cleveland\nSPACES (Cleveland)\nOregon\nPortland Institute for Contemporary Art (Portland)\nPublication Studio (Portland)\nRocks Box Fine Arts (Portland)\nBlue Sky, the Oregon Center for the Photographic Arts (Portland)\nMuseum of Contemporary Craft in partnership with Pacific Northwest College of Art (Portland)\nRocksboxfineart State University Art Dept.

We have a lot of friends who felt left out. We needed to spend more time letting our friends know where this was going. I regret that.\"\n[17]\nAfter the controversy, the Smithsonian Board of Regents convened a panel of experts, which recommended that “in the absence of actual error, changes to exhibitions should not be made once an exhibition opens without meaningful consultation with the curator, director, secretary and the leadership of the Board of Regents.”\n[18]\nAt the Fales Library\nThe proliferation of versions of\nA Fire in My Belly\nbeing shown publicly, along with inaccurate statements made about them in the media, prompted Marvin Taylor and Brent Phillips at the Fales Library and Special Collections to release a fact sheet about\nA Fire In My Belly.\nIt stated:\nIn the rush of reporting on the National Portrait Gallery’s removal of David Wojnarowicz’s film A Fire in My Belly several inaccuracies have been reported and reprinted/posted.  Below are some corrections to those errors based on the primary source material held in the David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library, New York University.\n1. A Fire in My Belly was originally shot on Super8mm film and did not have a completed soundtrack. It is not a “video.”\n2. A Fire in My Belly was never completed by Wojnarowicz. A text panel at the end of the film reads: “Film In Progress, David Wojnarowicz, 1986-7.”\n3. The incomplete A Fire in My Belly runs 13 minutes. Had it been completed it would have run longer. We have a cutting script Wojnarowicz was working from, thus we know that there are sections not included in this segment.\n4. A Fire in My Belly was not created as an homage to Peter Hujar. In fact, it is questionable if it was created as a response to AIDS. It predates Wojnarowicz’s finding out that he was HIV positive and the change in his work that reflects his status.\n5. An additional section/chapter/excerpt from A Fire in My Belly was located on another film reel in Wojnarowicz’s collection. It runs 7 minutes. These sections are listed in the cutting script under the section heading “Prostitution.”. This section was used by Wojnarowicz and Rosa von Praunheim in von Praunheim’s film Silence = Death, 1989. We have a super8 film roll that Wojnarowicz titled that reads “Peter, etc…. Mexico, etc.” and contains the name “Michael Lupetin” written in pencil and has Wojnarowicz’s  phone number “228-7024 NYC”—all written in Wojnarowicz’s hand. Lupetin was the producer of Silence=Death. Based on the edge code, the film stock is dated 1986-7.\n6. A 4-minute edit of this 7-minute excerpt was used in the Hide/Seek exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery with an added soundtrack derived from an audiocassette from Wojnarowicz’s Papers of a June 1989 ACT-UP demonstration. This added soundtrack was not part of the artist’s original work and/or vision and probably has led people to think that A Fire in My Belly was about the AIDS crisis. The addition of this soundtrack was approved by the Wojnarowicz estate.\n7. The YouTube version of FIMB with music from Plague Mass by Diamanda Galas was loaded by Semiotext(e). This version originally appeared in Rosa von Praunheim’s film Silence = Death, 1989. The master footage for this version with the Galas soundtrack is not in the David Wojnarowicz Papers at the Fales Library nor is there any indication that Wojnarowicz created this version. It is debatable whether the piece included in von Praunhiem's film could be called A Fire in My Belly. The most we can accurately say is that the footage was removed by Wojnarowicz from A Fire in My Belly and given to Michael Lupetin for use in Silence=Death.\n8.

Courtesy Richard Kern.\nYou Killed Me First Installation #8\nwas created in December 1985 by David Wojnarowicz in collaboration with\nRichard Kern\n. It was composed of the film\nYou Killed Me First\n(1985) and a multi-media installation that incorporated film, audio, visuals, and smells. It was up for one month at\nGround Zero\n; the work was Wojnarowicz’s response to gallery owners\nJames Romberger\nand\nMarguerite van Cook\n's request for a work that outraged, inspired, and challenged. It was a piece that “they'd never get a chance to do anywhere else because no one in their right mind would let them do it.”\n[1]\nWojnarowicz and Kern developed the idea for the film and installation after shooting up ecstasy on a late night in the fall of 1985.\n[2]\nKern initially was interested in exploring the mental life of the younger generation in the East Village; he was particularly fascinated by a young model named\nElizabeth Carr (Lung Leg)\n, whom Kern had met while filming the video for Sonic Youth's \"Death Valley '69.\"\n[3]\nKern wanted to center the film on a dysfunctional family, and use anecdotes from the family lives of those in their social circle to build out the story. Over two days in October 1985, they shot the film\nYou Killed Me First\nin the loft of artist Charles Hinman, for whom Kern was working as an assistant. It starred\nKaren Finley\n(mother), Lung Leg (Elisabeth/Cassandra),\nMontana Hewson\n(Elisabeth/Cassandra's boyfriend), Jessica Craig-Martin (Deborah), and Nick Cooper (Deborah's boyfriend). The script was improvised. The film takes place on Thanksgiving Day where a misunderstood teenage daughter Elisabeth/Cassandra sits down with her “normal” family for a meal. After a series of flashbacks that reveal traumatic past events, the film transitions back to the present where she kills her entire family around the dinner table and angrily proclaims, “You killed me first!” According to Lung Leg, \"about fifty percent of it was directly from David Wojnarowicz's childhood,\"\n[3]\nspecifically those scenes concerning his abusive father, who Wojnarowicz essentially played in the film. The scenes where the father figure shoots a gun into the air and slaughters a rabbit are specific events from Wojnarowicz's life. In the last scene, the camera pans across the dead family. For the installation at\nGround Zero\n, Wojnarowicz took this scene and constructed a real-life, interactive artwork.\nFor the installation, Wojnarowicz and Kern drove around town to steal cement blocks and mortar from building sites. Using these materials, they built a set inside\nGround Zero\n. A long and narrow alley leading to a cement wall was replicated inside the gallery space. Wojnarowicz painted NO PARKING 24 HOUR along with other graffiti to imitate the aesthetic of an actual alley. Colored lightbulbs lit the space in blue and red. To further the alley's effect, Wojnarowicz and his friends collected detritus (dog shit, trash, hubcaps, etc.) from the 1980's New York streets to litter the space. An audio track of foghorns and the scurrying feet of rats played on loop. For those who dared to make their way down the alley, they would find themselves looking through a broken window onto the dead family from Kern's film. For his corpses, David covered skeletons in maps and paint and dressed them to portray the characters from the film. In the center of the group sat a table with a rotting Thanksgiving meal. Kern's film played on loop on a small television the back left corner. This was the film’s debut; despite the unusual viewing context the video was completely visible and audible for the audience on the other side of the wall. At the opening, Kern passed out joints to attendees and encouraged them to smoke them inside for a “special effect.”\n[4]\nBy the end of the month, the smell of rotting meat and trash was unbearable.\nContents\n1\nThemes\n1.1\nFamily\n1.2\nVoyeurism\n2\nMedia and Techniques\n2.1\nSkeletons\n3\nLocation\n4\nPeople\n5\nCuratorial Information\n6\nConservation History\n7\nCritical Reception\n8\nRelated Works\n9\nInstallation View\n10\nReferences\n11\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\nThemes\nFamily\nWojnarowicz’s childhood was a frequent topic of his autobiographical writing and conversations with friends, but he did not start addressing childhood and family trauma in his work until his\nBurning Child\ninstallation at\nGracie Mansion Gallery\nin 1984. For the rest of his career, Wojnarowicz continued to plum the theme of dysfunctional family units and vulnerable children, with\nInstallation #5\nand You Killed Me First/Installation #8. In Installation #8 in particular, the film’s narrative allows Wojnarowicz and Kern to explore the idea of adolescent rebellion against the hypocrisy of the values of the previous generation; while the parents lecture their teenage daughter about religious values and gather around a traditional turkey dinner, the teenager creates her own world out of voodoo dolls and drawings, eventually taking the ultimate revenge for her abuse through patricide.\nVoyeurism\nRomberger explains that Wojnarowicz had probably been slightly influenced by Marcel Duchamp's last piece\nÉtant donnés\n. The artwork was a tableau that was only visible through a pair of peepholes of a nude woman laying on her back in the grass with her legs spread. Reminiscent of this technique, Wojnarowicz's installation lead his audience down a dark “alley” to a broken window that seemed to appear a part of a tenement where they were able to peak onto a family dinner that had been interrupted by a brutal homicide.\nWojnarowicz revisits this motif quite often in his and Romberger's book\nSeven Miles a Second\nwhere within the first section, he is pictured peeping through a hole of a door\n[5]\n.\nMedia and Techniques\nYou Killed Me First\nwas filmed on Kern’s Canon Super-8mm camera. All props were scavenged or provided by Kern and Wojnarowicz. Wojnarowicz bought a turkey for the dinner scene, and used his car to transport other items. Kern supplied the gun, a starter pistol. There was no script, just a scene list, and the actors improvised their lines. Montanna assisted with the “special effects”, including the explosions during the scene when the family is shot. Cow’s blood was procured from a local butcher. Kern purchased fake intestines from a prop shop.\nThe installation utilized tape recorders to loop sound, a television to loop video, and found items. The cement blocks and mortar for the cement wall were stolen from building sites. Kern built the wall and window according to Wojnarowicz’s design. The blood splattered on the walls behind the corpses' heads was real pig's blood obtained from a local butcher. The detritus strewn within the space was gathered from the streets of New York.\nIn order to be screened on loop, the film was transferred to video. Kern recalls that he did the transfer at Boston film lab\nBrodsky and Treadway\nbecause they didn’t care about shocking content (he worked with some labs in New York who would refuse to make transfers of his films). There, the film was transferred on a ¾ inch master, which Kern dubbed, and then made VHS dubs of the duplicate. In the installation, the video was played using a VHS tape and VHS playback machine. Kern speculated that the TV that played the video had been scavenged along with the building materials.\n[6]\nSkeletons\nWhen Kern and Wojnarowicz first began discussing\nYou Killed Me First\n, Kern recalled Wojnarowicz used the skeletons as a starting point: “He said, ‘Well I’ve got these skeletons I want to do something with. I’ve got this whole family of skeletons I bought.”\n[7]\nIn January 1985, Wojnarowicz had purchased human skeletons and a\nbaby elephant skeleton\nin Paris and had them shipped to friend\nKeith Davis\n. Gallerist\nSur Rodney Sur\nrecalls that the humans were shipped inside the cavity of the elephant.\n[8]\n. Though it is not clear how many were procured, Kern and Sur felt certain that he only had 3 skeletons--a family unit. Three skeletons, two adults and a child, appear in\nInstallation #5\n(where they were painted and papered over with maps) and Installation #8 (where they were covered with pig's blood and flesh-like plaster).\n[9]\nIn between these two installations, and after\nYou Killed Me First\n, the skeletons were stored in the basement of\nGracie Mansion Gallery\n. Later they were transferred to Sur Rodney Sur’s apartment after one of the artists at Gracie Masion Gallery made a complaint.\n[10]\nLocation\nNew York City:\nInstallation #8\nwas installed in\nJames Romberger\nand\nMarguerite Van Cook's\ngallery\nGround Zero\n– specifically the second location on E 10th Street facing Tompkins Square Park. The film was shot at Charles Hinman's loft at the edge of the Lower East Side and Soho. The film is closely associated with the Cinema of Transgression, a movement of filmmakers based in New York's East Village and Lower East Side.\nPeople\nElizabeth Carr (Lung Leg)\nLung Leg starred in the film and was Kern's initial inspiration for the project.\nKaren Finley\nFinley starred as the mother in the film. Originally the part belonged to another woman who backed out at the last minute. Wojnarowicz, who was close with Finley, suggested her as a replacement.\nRichard Kern\nWojnarowicz collaborated with Kern to create both the film\nYou Killed Me First\nas well as the installation\nYou Killed Me First Installation #8\n.\nMontana Hewson\nMontanna assisted with the filming and starred in the film.\nJames Romberger\nand\nMarguerite Van Cook\nRomberger and Van Cook were the gallery owners of\nGround Zero\n. They encouraged challenging installation work within their space, at a time when few other galleries were willing to take those risks.\nSur Rodney Sur\nSur is an artist and was the co-director of Gracie Mansion Gallery.\nTommy Turner\nand others\nWojnarowicz also recruited other friends such as Tommy Turner to help collect debris for the installation.\nCuratorial Information\nThe installation was exhibited only once at\nGround Zero\nin 1985.\nConservation History\nAt the Fales Library, Kern's film exists on a VHS tape as part 1 of 3 other works. The film is also available\nYoutube\n.\nCritical Reception\nYou Killed Me First\nis a landmark work in the Cinema of Transgression, a movement that consisted of a loosely affiliated group of filmmakers who used shock and humor in their work in New York’s Lower East Side in the 1980s, including\nRichard Kern\n, Nick Zedd, Lydia Lunch,\nTommy Turner\n, and Kembra Pfahler. Zedd coined the term Cinema of Transgression in the “The Cinema of Transgression Manifesto” published under the pseudonym Orion Jeriko in his zine The Underground Film Bulletin. Due to the patricidal themes of\nYou Killed Me First\n, the film captured the confrontational nature of Zedd’s manifesto: “a new generation of filmmakers daring to rip out of the stifling straight jackets of film theory in a direct attack on every value system known to man.”\n[11]\nA 2012 retrosective of the Cinema of Transgression at KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin was titled\nYou Killed Me First: The Cinema of Transgression.\nRelated Works\nInstallation #5\nInstallation View\nReferences\n↑\nCynthia Carr,\nFire in the Belly: The Life and Times of David Wojnarowicz\n(New York, Bloomsbury, 2012): 313\n↑\nSee\nRichard Kern’s interview\non this site\n↑\n3.0\n3.1\nCarr, Cynthia.

(For example, ‘I spent nine days in a hospital emergency room corridor. They sent me home when I refused a colonoscopy in the hallway.’) They began the installation by constructing a labyrinth with black plastic bags. They wrote out the stories they'd collected on large sheets of paper and attached those to the billowing walls. This maze led to a grotesque sickroom where, in a corner, a skeleton lay under a blanket on a cot. Decorating the walls around the cot was a screed about access to health care and other issues affecting the politicized body. On a nightstand sat many bottles of pills and a small TV pumping out daytime drivel, crowned on top with an actual dead cockroach. there was garbage on the floor, splotches of vomit, a Raggedy Ann. In the hallway leading from this room, blue hands reached out of the walls. This led to a ship of fools and its papier-mâché passengers--Cardinal O'Connor, Jesse Helms, and George H.W. Bush. They floated across a sea in mid-cry and hundreds of human hands reached out for help. Past this centerpiece came a dancing Howdy Doody, who talked nonstop…. Just outside the installation stood three long tables covered with pamphlets, fact sheets, condoms, and needle bleaching kits from a diverse selection of groups trying to address the crisis. The soundtrack to it all, on a loop, was what David claimed as his favorite song, Louie Armstrong’s ‘What a Wonderful World.’”\n[1]\nFor more on this installation see interview with Paul Marcus in\nDavid Wojnarowicz: A definitive history of five or six years on the Lower East Side\n, Eds.

Wojnarowicz thought Romberger’s work was good and that Civilian Warfare should include them in a show. A year later, after Savard moved Civilian Warfare to another location, he offered the gallery space to Romberger and Van Cook. This became the first Ground Zero location. The space was small but a year later, the couple moved the gallery to a larger space on East Tenth Street where Wojnarowicz first exhibited with them. Romberger and Van Cook asked for a work that would challenge and inspire; Wojnarowicz produced\nYou Killed Me First Installation #8\n. This work took over half the gallery space. The following year in 1986, Ground Zero moved once again to their final space. Wojnarowicz exhibited\nMexican Diaries\nhere.

Below it were two video monitors on a stand, running some of the\nITSOFOMO\nfootage.

The foreground of the painting depicts a child-size skeleton in front of a burning fire, “a symbol of primitive or early energy.”\n[1]\nDebris that Wojnarowicz had collected with\nSteve Brown\n,\nSteve Doughton\n, and Amy Turner, he collected debris and detritus from abandoned lots around the city—including items like a rusted car door, television set shell, tires, window shards, bricks, and barbed wire--formed the ground of the scene, arranged to form and hide a series of caves that referred again to a primordial landscape. Wojnarowicz installed the\nBurning Child\nsculpture so that it appeared to be running toward a tree hung with animal skulls, a reference to a Mayan creation myth\n[2]\nThe installation incorporated blue strobe lights, which Wojnarowicz had read was connected with healing energy\n[3]\n, and an audiotape soundtrack he had created with\nDoug Bressler\nwith sounds including marching, children’s shouting,  and mortar attacks.\n[4]\nThe dense references, which also include Hopi imagery, kachina dolls, animal symbols, and other architectural details, are explained in a four-page document he provided to the Mnuchins, a copy of which is in the Wojnarowicz Artist File at the Frances Mulhall Achilles Library,\nWhitney Museum of American Art\n.\nInstallation Views at the Mnuchin mansion 1985\nInstllation View at Frieze New York 2016\nPeople\nSteve Brown\nBrownwas an artist and filmmaker who assisted Wojnarowicz with various film projects and installations.\nSteve Doughton\nDoughton was a friend and collaborator with Wojnarowicz, who contributed to the\nWard Line Pier Project\n.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Mnuchin_Installation&oldid=3988\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInstallations\nThis page was last modified on 3 April 2017, at 14:36.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

In front of it were targets like those used on a firing range, with a deer pictured at center. On the back wall he painted a field\nof cow carcasses, beheaded and slit open.

In early 1983, Wojnarowicz and\nMike Bidlo\nbegan inviting artists to create paintings and installations at Pier 34 as an alternative exhibition site to the burgeoning commercial scene in the East Village. Hundreds of artists participated; Wojnarowicz called the pier \"the real MoMA.”\n[1]\nThe installations soon extended to the lesser-known Pier 28. By June of 1983 the police had cracked down on artists’ use of the pier, and the pier was torn down the next year.\nStatement by Jean Foos\nJean Foos\nis an artist who frequently worked with Wojnarowicz, including at the Ward Line Pier. According to Foos:\nAt the pier we have photos of David using cans of Pearl Paint acrylic paint. Since the pier was on Canal street it was easy to stop there on the way. When David invited\nDirk\nand I to go to the pier in early Spring of 1983, we made a stop at my studio where I collected assorted art supplies. I painted primarily in oils, and so gathered all my lower quality enamel and acrylic house paint, rollers, and old brushes that I had. I also brought some silver paint and spray bottles which I used. I’m pretty sure I gave David some supplies once we got there. Also, my bag of supplies had disappeared by my second visit. Everyone had to bring their own supplies, but many used the trash and debris piled everywhere. David painted and wrote a poem on a shade bracket that he found there— I still have it and will lend it to the upcoming Pier show. David and\nKiki Smith\nplanted grass in one dirt-filled room. I stopped going after I finished my room, but I know David stayed on and learned much about painting from people like\nLuis Frangella\nand\nJudy Glantzman\n.\nRegarding materials used—we found 2 x 4’s to easily scrape away peeling paint and expose wonderful smooth plaster walls. We found old ladders, chairs or piles of trash to stand on and broom poles to tape brushes to.\nMedia and techniques\nAll artists invited to create work at the Pier brought their own supplies, and many used the trash and debris already located onsite.\nJean Foos\nrecalls bringing low-quality enamel and acrylic housepaint, and old brushes on her visit; by the next visit, her bag had disappeared. She also recalled picking up acrylic paint from Pearl Paint, located on Canal street, on the way to the Pier.\n[2]\nFound two-by-fours were used to scrape of peeling paint and reveal the plaster walls for painting surfaces. Broom handles were co-opted to create long paintbrush handles.\nConservation and display\nThese site-specific painting installations were meant to be temporary.\nInstallation Views\nImages by\nMarion Scemama\nof Pier 28 and 34 can be found in Fales, Wojnarowicz Papers, Series IX, Subseries F, Box 84.

Cameron’s essay examines Wojnarowicz’s use of layered and collaged imagery in his paintings, stencils, sculptures and his combinations of photography and text. Rizk’s essay surveys the collage aesthetic of Wojnarowicz’s life and work as a method of recording his experience of society’s pre-existing contexts and reconstructing alternative connotations and narratives of his own history and of the signs of the world. Carr’s and Carlin’s essays are mostly biographical. The texts by Wojnarowicz are excerpted from his writings published elsewhere including “Memories That Smell Like Gasoline,” “The Waterfront Journals,” “Close to the Knives,” and “In the Shadow of the American Dream.” The catalogue is also well illustrated.\nDavid Wojnarowicz: Tongues of Flame\nBlinderman, Barry.

It draws attention to his numerous collaborative projects in order to explore the role of an interactive subjectivity in his art and in the community of the East Village art scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s more generally. Beginning with a focus on downtown living conditions, the problem of gentrification and its complex relationship with artistic communities in the East Village, I explore Wojnarowicz’s early fascination with drug culture and criminality and their representation in his early work: the ‘acid jam’ painting sessions led by\nCarlo McCormick\n, Wojnarowicz’s work at Civilian Warfare gallery, and the Ward Line Pier Project (1983), a major collaboration with painter\nMike Bidlo\n. Drawing on this socio-economic analysis, the focus then shifts to explore collaboration in Wojnarowicz’s work as a form of ‘citational grafting’; a means of exploring ideas of queer history, genealogy and identity in 'multigenerational' collaborations with queer writers that fits with processes of collaboration in Wojnarowicz’s work as a whole. Jacques Derrida’s writings on ‘hauntology’ frame the discussion of works like the photographic series Arthur Rimbaud in New York (1978-9), and xeroxed collages of Jean Genet, which concludes with Wojnarowicz’s death bed portraits of Peter Hujar, and explores the impact of HIV/AIDS on this queer collaborative practice.\nDavid Wojnarowicz's Fire in My Belly\nPhillips, Brent. \"David Wojnarowicz's A Fire in My Belly.\" The Back Table: Archives and Special Collections at New York University. 2010.\nThis article by Brent Phillips, the Audiovisual Archivist at Fales Library, presents factual information about the various versions of Wojnarowicz’s film “A Fire in My Belly.” The original version in Wojnarowicz’s collection at Fales is a 13 min. super 8mm silent film that the artist did not complete. Phillips’s article explains that excerpts and alternate versions of the film with different soundtracks have been shown in various exhibitions, which have given rise to differing interpretations, confusion and controversy surrounding the film.\nWojnarowicz's Apostasy\nRomberger, James. \"Wojnarowicz's Apostasy.\" The Hooded Utilitarian. 2010.\nIn his article \"Wojnarowicz's Apostasy,\"\nJames Romberger\n, artist and co-founder of Ground Zero Gallery which showed Wojnarowicz’s work in the 1980s, surveys Wojnarowicz’s political activism, his use of religious imagery, and the filming of “A Fire in My Belly” in addition to the film’s recent censorship issues. The article also describes Wojnarowicz’s collaborations with\nMarion Scemama\nand\nTommy Turner\nand his solo and group exhibitions at Ground Zero Gallery including the “You Killed Me First” installation.\nThe Archival Object: A Memoir of Disintegration\n[archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/download/13212/14492_1 Darms, Lisa. \"The Archival Object: A Memoir of Disintegration.\" Archivaria 67 (Spring 2009): 143-155.]\nHeld at Fales Library and Special Collection, Wojnarowicz’s\n“Magic Box”\ncontains 69 objects collected by Wojnarowicz such as plastic toys, jewelry, stones, feathers, seeds, photographs and others. Through both theoretical and practical analysis, Darms's article examines the ways in which the “Magic Box” disrupts archival and art historical concepts of classification, provenance, context, description and inscription in addition to discussing the box and its contents in light of the dual symbolic and material value of all archival documents. Darms’s text presents the “Magic Box” as an example of the ways in which Wojnarowicz’s art and life subvert traditional notions of classification and thus must be examined and exhibited in ways that reveal their evolving complexity.\nOdd Man Out\nCooper, Dennis. “Odd Man Out.” Artforum (October 1999): 130-131, 168.\n[\nwill need to pull Artforum from stacks to write this annotation\n]\nOut of the Safety Zone\nLippard, Lucy. \"Out of the Safety Zone.\"\nArt in America\n(December 1990): 131-139, 182, 186.\nThis article was the cover story for\nArt in America\nin 1990.\nLucy Lippard\noffers a detailed biography of Wojnarowicz and a sweeping account of his practice, with frequent first person observations. Lippard uses Wojnarowicz's words throughout the piece, quoting from published writings and from an interview she conducted with Wojnarowicz in December 1989. She offers extensive analysis of the \"Four Elements\" exhibition at Gracie Mansion in 1987 and of the\nSex Series\n. Lippard explores the importance of religious, spiritual, sexual, and travel imagery in Wojnarowicz’s works, his committed political activism, and noted his affinities with specific writers such as Jean Genet and William S. Burroughs. This article situates Wojnarowicz’s work in the milieu of the downtown art scene in New York in the 1980s and in relation to montage techniques of Surrealism, Dada, and comics.\nIdeas and Emotions\nDeitcher, David. \"Ideas and Emotions.\"\nArtforum\n(May 1989):122-127.\nDeitcher’s article situates Wojnarowicz’s work in relation to historical avant-gardism though the artist's use of montage, collective processes, and an activist model for social transformation. Wojnarowicz’s “Sex Series”of photomontages and his photographs of\nPeter Hujar\nare discussed at length through formal description of the imagery, critical interpretations, and descriptions of the processes by which they were created. Deitcher’s analysis interweaves a wide range of themes in Wojnarowicz’s work--private and public, sex and surveillance, emotional and political conditions.\nQueer Acts of Recovery and Uncovering: Deciphering Mexico through Archival Ephemera in David Wojnarowicz's A Fire in My Belly\nTyburczy, Jennifer. \"Queer Acts of Recovery and Uncovering: Deciphering Mexico through Archival Ephemera in David Wojnarowicz's A Fire in My Belly.\" Text & Performance Quarterly\n31, no. 1, 4-23.

The article considers itself a \"a transnational project of queer critique.\"\nCruising the Queer Ruins of New York's Abandoned Waterfront\nFiona Anderson (2015) Cruising the Queer Ruins of New York's Abandoned Waterfront, Performance Research, 20:3, 135-144, DOI: 10.1080/13528165.2015.1049047\nABSTRACT: In late 1970s New York, prior to the advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, artists and writers including David Wojnarowicz, Alvin Baltrop, Peter Hujar, and John Rechy walked the piers of the city's derelict waterfront in search of anonymous sex with the myriad men who cruised there. The buildings became props in the sexual encounters that took place there. The derelict landscape of the harbour and Wojnarowicz's erotic reaction to the forms of the warehouses themselves shaped his poetic ideas of non-linear, achronological ‘cruising time’ and architectural memory. In this article, I explore cruising in the ruins of the abandoned Lower West Side waterfront in the immediate pre-AIDS period, examining these artists’ sense of the queer temporality of the piers, where images of past and present raced ‘back and forth’ incoherently. I explore the visual culture of the waterfront and its cruising scene using, primarily, photographs, and other artworks and writings by Wojnarowicz and others as my guide, following their interest in the erotic appeal of ruins and the ‘traces of time embedded’ in these derelict buildings. I explore how the ruins of the piers, seen now through photographs and in archival materials, function presently as a means of figuring the early years of HIV/AIDS in New York and its pre-history through a rhetoric different from that of degeneration. By turning to the treatment of this ruined place in waterfront work from the pre-AIDS era, placing the past and present of the piers and the queer lives that they hosted in a non-linear open-ended dialogue with each other, I argue that we may escape the unexpectedly homophobic causality that contemporary ‘ruin lust’ and the idea of this late-1970s moment as a ‘last days of Rome’ both seem to point to.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Bibliography--Articles_on_Wojnarowicz&oldid=3966\n\"\nCategory\n:\nSelected Bibliography\nThis page was last modified on 3 April 2017, at 14:00.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

She and Wojnarowicz met in 1984 when she was she on assignment to shoot him for the magazine\nICI New York\n, and they became close friends. They collaborated on multiple works of\nfilm, video\nand\npainting\n, many of which combined her photography with Wojnarowicz's imagery. They were also frequently the subjects of one another's camera. Scemama went on several trips throughout the country with him, and spent significant time in the studio assisting him with production, particularly in 1989.\nInterview Abstract\nScemama and Wojnarowicz’s first collaborations were in photography [00:48]. Their first photographs were at the\npiers\nwhen Scemama was doing a story about the East Village. Although she always considered herself to be a photojournalist, Wojnarowicz was the first to tell her that she was an artist. Before Scemama, Wojnarowicz had already had experience with a camera but because of\nPeter Hujar\n, Scemama speculates, he may have lacked confidence in his own skill [07:21]. Though Scemama was also a photographer, she did not intimidate David. Rather, they continually encouraged and supported one another, creating a strong friendship. The two often worked together, including a work that exhibited at T. Greathouse Gallery where Greer Lankton also showed [08:30]. Aside from photography, the two also collaborated on film [13:04]. These were never documentaries. They were always creative projects. They collaborated on his film with\nRosa von Praunheim\n. At the time, Scemama was in Paris, but Wojnarowicz quickly contacted her for assistance. She essentially acted as an extension of Wojnarowicz’s own eyes. Often these collaborative projects stemmed from David’s creative mind but there was never a power trip [22:35]. His works were often deliberately planned out despite their improvisatory appearance. Even if storyboards were incomplete, David knew what would happen from start to finish [25:56]. Now, years after Wojnarowicz’s death, Scemama will be creating a film titled\nSelf-Portrait in 23 Rounds\nthat will showcase the process of David’s work [35:25].

Through their interest in photography, they became friends and collaborated on films such as\nWhere Evil Dwells\n(1985). Turner also accompanied Wojnarowicz to Mexico when he was capturing footage for his project\nA Fire In My Belly (film in progress)\n. When Wojnarowicz worked on\nYou Killed Me First Installation #8\n, Turner helped him fill the installation with trash.\nInterview Abstract\nTommy Turner and David Wojnarowicz met when working together at the Peppermint Lounge. They became friends over their interest in photography. The two went shooting together at non-tourist spots and locations they found odd. Through this friendship, they came together to collaborate on the Super 8 film,\nWhere Evil Dwells\n[16:30]. Turner discusses their work process and how they would initially discuss ideas over breakfast or coffee but eventually became serious and got to writing. They did not have any storyboards but did plan out scenes on location. Wojnarowicz went on to produce other films such as\nA Fire in My Belly\n[23:57]. This film was not a collaboration with Turner but the two traveled to Mexico together to capture footage. Right after a devastating earthquake that left Mexico City in shambles, Wojnarowicz traversed into a world that allowed him to capture extreme urban decay where “people with no legs were breathing fire and going up to cars.” Taylor asks Turner whether he knows anything about the possible abandonment of this film and how footage from the script was removed and given to\nRosa von Praunheim\nfor his documentary film\nSilence = Death\n[27:56]. Turner does not remember nor knows. Turner then discusses Wojnarowicz’s film showings that usually took place at underground festivals [29:12]. Lastly, the question of whether Wojnarowicz would have wanted his works to be shown in museums with white walls is discussed. Since his death, people have displayed his works more frequently [33:47]. Though he did want to be successful in the art world, Turner explains that he had a love-hate relationship with it.\nClick here for interview text\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\nTurner, Tommy\n‎\n(\n← links\n)\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_with_Tommy_Turner_by_Glenn_Wharton_and_Marvin_Taylor_on_5-20-2016&oldid=4284\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterviews\nThis page was last modified on 2 May 2017, at 19:37.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

The three artists also collaborated on the graphic novel\nSeven Miles a Second\n.\nInterview Abstract\nJames Romberger and Marguerite Van Cook were the owners of\nGround Zero Gallery\n, where Wojnarowicz exhibited many of his works, such as his collaborative work with\nRichard Kern\n–\nYou Killed Me First Installation #8\n. The two gallerists first met Wojnarowicz at\nDean Savard\n’s gallery\nCivilian Warfare\n, which later became their first gallery space [04:36]. As gallerists, the two worked with artists to encourage them to push themselves to their furthest limits. Their gallery also offered a space that allowed for installation work, which was not often possible at the time [08:47]. As the interview continues, Romberger and Van Cook continue to discuss their roles as gallerists, artists, and their relationship with Wojnarowicz. At [17:37], Romberger and Van Cook elaborate on\nInstallation #8\n. While speaking about the piece, they also discuss some of Wojnarowicz’s influences, both literary and artistic. Having such a close relationship with David, they understood, to some extent, what he intended from his work. When audiences and critics tried to argue that\nA Fire in My Belly\ndid not attack the Catholic church, Romberger understood that the film was absolutely attacking the church [35:45]. It was not uncommon for people who did not know Wojnarowicz to misunderstand his art and humor.\nToday, now that some of Wojnarowicz’s works are deteriorating, the problem of conservation comes into question [39:50]. Both Romberger and Van Cook believe that David would have wanted his works to be preserved. However, some problems can spawn from the paints he used. He was particular about the blue he used – Utrecht blue, but was also quite indifferent, using whatever house paints were on hand [47:55]. He was quite economical and would often mix art supplies with Romberger and Van Cook. Towards the end of his life, the three collaborated on\nSeven Miles a Second\nwhich was not completed until after his death [55:37]. The interview ends with Romberger and Van Cook giving suggestions on other possible interview candidates."}

The data is organized by series, subseries, and box. Descriptions are given to objects that are untitled. Each object was analyzed and documented for instances of some of Wojnarowicz’ common themes found in his work. We hope that this database will be a useful tool for future researchers, and we encourage new scholars to add to the database as they see fit.\nHenry, John B: \"The Installations and Ephemeral Art of David Wojnarowicz\" May 2017\nAbstract\nThe primary function of this thesis is to describe and collect documentation of the installation and ephemeral artwork produced by David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) throughout distinct parts of his artistic career. These intricate installations and thought-provoking ephemeral projects are emblematic of his biography, corpus, and the culture of art in the rapidly changing landscape of New York City in the 1980s, yet we know very little about them. The nature of installation is interdisciplinary and often ephemeral; It is a medium that engages the space it is presented in, the context of the things around it, and the time/duration it is given. This thesis surveys the installation artworks by Wojnarowicz both visually and critically while drawing lines of connection to his work in other media.\nClick here to download this research paper\nKramer, Lia: “Material Analysis of Plastic Objects in the Magic Box\" April 4, 2017\nAbstract\nIn this study, NYU IFA conservation graduate student Lia Kramer selected plastic objects from the David Wojnarowicz’s\nMagic Box\nfor material analysis. Identification of the types of plastics comprising these items will inform preventive conservation treatments to preserve the items without separating the contents from the box where possible. Small samples were taken from each component of the 10 objects selected for analysis by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). All samples were successfully identified. Resulting analysis data spectra, identification characteristics, and suggestions for preventive measures are included in the report.\nClick here to download this research paper\nSlautina, Maria: “David Wojnarowicz: Is ‘Untitled, Face in Dirt' a Co-Authored Work?”\nDecember 9, 2015\nAbstract\nIn this graduate student paper, Maria Slautina investigates questions of authorship for\nUntitled, Face in Dirt\n. She begins with the problem that Wojnarowicz set up the photograph and directed his friend and colleague photographer\nMarion Scemama\nto take the image. The work is at times attributed to Wojnarowicz and at times attributed to Scemana. Slautina uses this question of authorship as a starting point for deeper exploration. In reading through the artist’s journals, she learned that some years prior he referred to a dream in which he had been buried in a way that is reminiscent of the image. She takes the reader through various entanglements, including whether we author our own dreams, and the nature of artistic co-authorships.\n(NB: In\nthe interview she gave for this site\n, Scemama says she is not the author of this work.)\nClick here to download this research paper\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Unpublished_Research_Papers&oldid=4379\n\"\nCategory\n:\nUnpublished Research\nThis page was last modified on 2 December 2017, at 10:21.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

The majority of Wojnarowicz's moving image works were filmed on 8mm, the most popular medium for downtown New York artists not only due to its lower cost but the raw, gritty, amateur quality that best mirrored the Lower East Side in the late '70s-'90s. Wojnarowicz had begun a very close relationship with\nTommy Turner\nand\nRichard Kern\n, principal figures of the Cinema of Transgression, in the 1980s. Wojnarowicz collaborated with friends for a majority of his films, most notably his collaboration with Turner for\nWhere Evil Dwells\n.\nClick\nHere\nfor information on\nA Fire in My Belly\n(1986-1987).\nContents\n1\nSelect Super 8mm Films\n1.1\nHeroin (1979)\n1.2\nWhere Evil Dwells (1985-1986)\n1.3\nBeautiful People (1988)\n2\nRichard Kern Collaborations\n2.1\nStray Dogs and Manhattan Love Suicides (1985)\n2.2\nYou Killed Me First (1985)\n2.3\nReferences\nSelect Super 8mm Films\nHeroin (1979)\nBefore having developed a relationship with artists involved in the Cinema of Transgression, Wojnarowicz already showed interested in the moving image. Wojnarowicz filmed\nHeroin\non a broken Super 8mm camera. The cast included high school friend, John Hall, and\n3TeensKill4-no motive\nband mates,\nBrian Butterick\nand\nJesse Hultberg\n.\n[1]\nThe unfinished film, running 00:02:50, took place at an abandoned warehouse on the Hudson River. Although\nHeroin\nis consistently dated to 1979,\nCynthia Carr\nmentions that\nPeter Hujar\n, who Wojnarowicz would not meet until 1980, was originally cast in the film.\nWojnarowicz's Account of\nHeroin\n\"\n[Heroin] has beautiful sections of these very weird symbols. A Person with a wrapped head, like an invisible man, would just sort of move into a room and through these endless door frames, like door frames on door frames on door frames, and all these beautiful elements of rust. So one figure's moving through the warehouse and another guy the same size, the same clothing, is moving in another direction and eventually they meet, on the roof, where you can see the Empire State Building, which is symbolic of the hypodermic. They collide on the rooftop. One holds out a gun and shoots the other in the head and all this ketchup flies out. He bends down and starts unwrapping the head and it turns out to be his own face that is revealed. Then it cuts into a hundred images of different people dead in their kitchens, on their rooftops, in their hallways, in the street.\"\n[2]\nWhere Evil Dwells (1985-1986)\nInitially titled,\nSatan Teens\n,\nWhere Evil Dwells\nwas an unfinished collaboration with\nTommy Turner\n. In September 1985, Wojnarowicz and Turner began writing a script based on a 1984 Long Island news story about a Satan worshipping teen committing murder. The script took three nights to complete. PCP-abusing metal-head Ricky Kasso, murdered his 17-year-old friend, Gary Lauwers in Northport, Long Island by stabbing him repeatedly and gouging his eyes out. Kasso bragged about the murder, showing friends in disbelief Lauwers decomposing body, while claiming that Satan approved. He was eventually arrested and hung himself in jail before his 18th birthday. Wojnarowicz and Turner not only found the story humorous but also symbolic of the generation.\n\"[Wojnarowicz] and Turner saw Kasso as the ultimate, aimless alienated kid and both could identify with that to some extent.\"\n[3]\nWojnarowicz was also inspired by his own childhood, in writing the script. He wanted to include\n\"Friends who had strange problems growing up.\"\nThis would manifest in the characters meant to portray Kasso's friends.\n[4]\nThe cast included Joe Coleman (The Devil), Nancy Coleman, Rockets Redglare (Jesus), Lung Leg, as well as Turner and Wojnarowicz.\n[5]\nTurner and Wojnarowicz recorded eight hours of footage. Turner edited the footage down to a silent 31-minute trailer, to be ready in time for the 1986 Downtown Film Festival.\nThe film was originally shot on a Canon 8mm camera, which Turner borrowed from\nRichard Kern\n. Although Turner claims that audio and footage was lost in a fire, Fales Library and Special Collections has two reels of Super 8mm film straight from the original camera. The film can be viewed with fragments of original audio, including voice-overs spoken through a Howdy Doody Doll and the song\nWhere Evil Dwells\nby Wiseblood.\nJim Thirlwell, at the time a leader for the band Wiseblood and known as the leader of thrash metal band Foetus, offered up his song about Ricky Kasso to be used in the film, under the stipulation that the song's title would also be the title of the film,\nWhere Evil Dwells\n.\n[6]\nBeautiful People (1988)\nBeautiful People\nwas a collaboration with longtime friend and 3TeensKill4-no motive bandmate,\nJesse Hultberg\n. Hultberg is the sole actor present in the film. The color and black and white Super 8mm film initially ran 30 minutes. It was screened in 1988 at the La Mama Theatre in the East Village, with a live soundtrack performed by Wojnarowicz and Hultberg.\nIn 2011, 19 years after Wojnarowicz death, Hultberg edited\nBeautiful People\nfor the HOWL festival in New York City. At the festival, an event was held entitled\nIn Peace and War, 3TeensKill4\nto honor the involved artists. This version was cut down to seven minutes and a 3TeensKill4 soundtrack was added, entitled\nSpecial Reserve,\nwhere Wojnarowicz's tape recorder can be heard.\nRichard Kern\nCollaborations\nStray Dogs and Manhattan Love Suicides (1985)\nIn Stray Dogs, which would become one of four segments included in Kern's\nManhattan Love Suicides\n, Wojnarowicz's collaboration does not extend beyond acting, getting\nBill Rice\nto sign onto the film, and possibly funding. Wojnarowicz stars as a fan infatuated with Bill Rice, following him around New York City. Rice takes Wojnarowicz's character home with him, getting him off the streets of New York. Wojnarowicz makes sexual advances on Rice, who does not oblige. Wojnarowicz becomes so sexually frustrated that he violently comes apart at the seams; blood pouring from his putrid smelling body, his arm falling off. Rice laughs at the gory scene before him and motions of Wojnarowicz to stay still on the floor, so he can create a sketch.\nLike\nWhere Evil Dwells\n, Jim Thirlwell also created the soundtrack for\nStray Dogs\n.\nYou Killed Me First (1985)\nAlthough one of the most important Super 8 films for the Cinema of Transgression is accredited to Kern, Wojnarowicz could certainly be viewed for this project as not only an actor but co-creator. Not only was the role of the father mostly inspired by David Wojnarowicz's own relationship with his father but Kern has exclaimed that 50% of the film was inspired by David's stories about his childhood in general. Wojnarowicz was also the person to get Karen Finley on board with the project after the initial actor for the role of \"Mother\" dropped out. Wojnarowicz offered to provide human skeletons for the film, which would instead be used for\nInstallation 8\nat\nGround Zero Gallery\n, conceived in conjunction with the film.\nReferences\n↑\n\"Heroin\".

Although the film was originally shot by Kern on Super 8mm, Kern had the film transferred to videocassette at a trusted facility, Brodsky-Treadway, in Boston for Wojnarowicz's installation. This is the first time that Wojnarowicz would incorporate video elements into his exhibited work. The video played on loop, with audio, throughout the extent of the installation, along with multiple recorders placed around the gallery of found nature sounds.\nFor more details about this installation, please visit the\nInstallation 8\npage.\nIn The Shadow of Forward Motion\n\"[Wojnarowicz] videotape was reportedly the most striking element of the performance piece.\"\n[1]\nNot only were the video element of Wojnarowicz's performance striking but it stands as the most completed moving image work by the artist. Many elements from\nIn The Shadow of Forward Motion\nor\nITSOFOMO'\ns video were edited together from Super 8mm footage Wojnarowicz's had taken over the last four years. Similar to the recontextualized Mexico footage in Rosa von Praunheim's\nSilence=Death\n, footage from Wojnarowic'z unfinished Mexico film, widely known as\nA Fire in My Belly\n, appears frequently in\nITSOFOMO.\nOriginally, the film was shown on as a multi-channel projection, alongside a live soundtrack performed by\nBen Neill\n. The performance was also performed with a four-channel projection on a single screen, synced with a record which included a recorded version of the previous performances. The text was recorded at Jim Thirwells studio, (Listed as Foetus studios), Lydia Lunch's studio (listed as Lunch Studio), and Fun City Studios. Voices were recorded at a \"Hollerin' Contest\" in North Carolina in 1989.  Although\nITSOFOMO\nwas edited on U-Matic, with the help of Phil Zwickler, who also provided a free editing facility, it was transferred to four VHS tapes for the original performances.

The below formats constitute the original moving image mediums in which Wojnarowicz was known to work with during his lifetime. For accessibility, and to ensure Wojnarowicz's films are available for years to come, these moving images are rarely viewed on these original formats.

This particular medium was a favorite of artists involved in the Cinema of Transgression, a movement Wojnarowicz flirted with while appearing in staple members' films, such as the works of\nRichard Kern\nand\nTommy Turner\n. Partially due to this influence and also the economic, amateur status of the medium, a majority of footage by Wojnarowicz was filmed on Super 8mm. Although this file format has contained a magnetic strip for recording audio since the early 1970s, Wojnarowicz Super 8mm films have been mostly acquired with no soundtrack included. The film base Wojnarowicz likely worked with would have been on cellulose triacetate, which is susceptible to vinegar syndrome, or a  decaying process which releases acetic acid. Due to their fragility, they are rarely accessible in their original format.\nSelected Works\nBeautiful People\n, 1988-1989\nWhere Evil Dwells\n, 1985, collaboration with Tommy Turner\nA Fire in My Belly, A Work in Progress\n1986-1987\nHeroin\n,1981\n16mm\n16mm is a plastic, analogue film format, originally released in 1935, as a more economical answer to filmmaking, especially for amateur use. There are few films shot or migrated to 16mm by Wojnarowicz. Although Super 8mm was the most popular moving image medium for the artist, likely shot on triacetate, all films have been posthumously transferred to polyester based 16mm film for archival preservation.\nSelected Works\nFear of Disclosure, The Psycho-social Implications of HIV Revelation\n, 1988\nAnalogue Betacam and Betacam SP\nBetcam was introduced in 1982 by Sony as a superior videocassette format to the consumer failed U-Matic system. Betacam SP was introduced in 1986, increasing recording time to 90 minutes and horizontal resolution to 340 lines. Both formats are magnetic tape based. Wojnarowicz rarely worked in these formats.\nSelected Works\nEleventh Hour; Art and AIDs #1\n, 1989 (Betcam)\nWOJO NEA #1\n, undated (Betacam SP)\nU-Matic Videocassette\nU-Matic, also nicknamed the \"Three-quarter,\" due to its size in inches, is a analogue video format, stored on magnetic tape, introduced by Sony in 1971. U-Matic was wholly an unsuccessful format with the consumer market and was therefore used primarily by television stations in the 1980s. Wojnarowicz would sometimes use this format for editing purposes and storing digital audio data, a common use of U-Matic.\nSelected Works\nITSOFOMO\n#3-Edit Master, 1989\nITSOFOMO\n- Dat Xfer Workprint (audio only), 1989\nVHS\nVideo Home Systems, released in 1977, are analogue video cassette, stored on magnetic videotape.

Irony lies in the fact that Wojnarowicz created less than five narrative short films, all which remain unfinished. Any films created primarily by Wojnarowicz that came to an extent of fruition were never fully realized, unlike the production of so many static works by the artist. Even with this knowledge, Wojnarowicz's immense collection of Super 8mm footage had another purpose. Wojnarowicz would often repurpose his Super 8 negatives for another medium altogether; photography.\nWojnarowicz put his thoughts on movement into practice, breaking up movements which the camera had captured into still images. A bulk of Wojnarowicz's photography comes directly from his Super 8mm negatives, even when he carried both a 35mm and Super 8 camera. For example, although Wojnarowicz's Mexico film remained unfinished, much of the footage was reappropriated by the artist, including for the development of film stills. Many of these stills would be exhibited in Wojnarowicz lifetime. Wojnarowicz would exhibit them as standalone photographs, glued together on board, or even within collages.\nMedia and Techniques\nWojnarowicz's  Super 8mm negatives were projected and developed onto photo paper. The film stills are black and white gelatin silver prints. When projecting the negatives onto photo paper, Wojnarowicz would sometimes leave in parts of the upper and lower frames. The inclusion of secondary frames alludes to the stilling of motion and exploits the process from moving image to static photograph.\nFor information on Wojnarowicz's developing techniques for gelatin silver prints Click\nHere\nSelected Works\n(Untitled) Still From Cockfight\nGelatin silver print\n1988-1989\nMexican Mummies\nThree gelatin silver prints on museum board\n1986-1987\n↑\nLippard, Lucy R. \"Passenger on the Shadows.\" Aperture, no. 137 (1994): 6-25.\nhttp://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2165/stable/24471705\n. p. 8.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Film_Stills&oldid=1771\n\"\nCategories\n:\nFilm and Video\nPhotography\nThis page was last modified on 13 October 2016, at 13:16.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

Lithograph, 35 x 47 ½ inches, Edition of 10. Courtesy of the Estate of David Wojnarowicz and P.P.O.W, New York\nWojnarowicz worked with commercial printing processes, such as Xerox, Photostat, and offset printing, throughout his career. He created stencil prints and monoprints, and explored fine art printing processes like lithography later in his career. He became well-known for his stenciled imagery in the early 1980s (for more on stencils, see\nstencils\n). His first non-stenciled prints were a collaboration with Kiki Smith. The two were inspired by a trove of found psychiatric tests they found at the abandoned Pier 28 that had been administered by the Psychiatric Clinic of the Court of General Sessions. They selected a group that included a section where offenders were asked to draw pictures of man and woman, and planned to produce a series of fine prints that they would then plaster in the streets.\n[1]\n. They received a grant for materials and produced an edition of 10 of silkscreened images from the found tests, with color lithographic images of Rorschach tests overlaid on top.\nIn 1984, Wojnarowicz produced an offset lithograph in collaboration with\nMarion Scemama\nfor\nBetween C & D\n, a Lower East Side literary magazine that was distributed folded in a Ziploc bag with original artwork on each binding. The collaborative poster demonstrates Wojnarowicz’s early experimentation with combining\ntext and photographic imagery\n. In this work, a photographic image of Wojnarowicz as apparent victim of a gay bashing (taken by Scemama) is paired with a text that reflects on the recent Supreme Court ruling suggesting that gay people had forfeited their constitutional right to privacy.\nAfter these early forays into print-making, Wojnarowicz published only six editioned lithographs in his lifetime, including the three prints published at Normal Editions Workshop when he was there preparing for the 1990 exhibition.\n[2]\nAt Normal’s print studio, Wojnarowicz created three multi-color lithographs. He arrived planning to a version of the four seasons, and two of the prints are centered on this theme:\nFire and Water\n, and\nEarth and Wind\n. In these works he used iconography familiar from elsewhere in his work, juxtaposing grounds made of currency, musical sheets, and supermarket advertisements with overlaid images of organs, nature, and fantastical creatures. In the third untitled print, he responded to his immediate concerns, using a\nNY Post\neditorial about the Artspace controversy as ground for drawings of a crucified voodoo doll, a circular inset of blood cells, and an earth encrusted with skeletons.\nContents\n1\nMedia and techniques\n2\nConservation and display\n3\nSelected works\n4\nPages on Knowledge Base that link to this page\n5\nReferences\nMedia and techniques\nFor the commercial printing processes, Wojnarowicz likely used a variety of local shops, including Todd’s Copy Shop on Mott Street between Prince and Spring, or Giant Photo.\nWojnarowicz learned how to screenprint from\nKiki Smith\nwhen they collaborated on the psychiatric test prints in 1983.\n[3]\nKeith Davis\nhad screenprinting equipment in his apartment and\nSteve Doughton\nrecalls Wojnarowicz and Davis screenprinting on top of supermarket posters there in the mid-1980s.\n[4]\nThese prints, likely\nTrue Myth (Domino Sugar)\nand\nJean Genet Masturbating in Metteray Prison\nwere made in 1983. The essential imagery in\nTrue Myth\nwas earlier rendered on the side of a building in New York City circa 1981.  Wojnarowicz recycled popular printed material from his extensive collection of ephemera to use as substrates for these prints; both\nTrue Myth\nand\nJean Genet\nare printed on recycled screenprinted supermarket posters. On such advertisements, Wojnarowicz later reflected:\n\"I like to subvert the intended use of printed material[s]. . . . It’s like whatever you can find that is just printed in the street that you can see just walking down the street. Whatever you see that is in use that has been printed I like to work with because there are a variety of meanings by putting any image on top of it.\"\n[5]\nOffset plates and metal plates for the production of the Between C & D poster can be found in Fales collection, Series XI, Mapcase 1J, folders 13 and 14.\nWojnarowicz learned how to work with lithography while working with the master printer\nRichard Finch\nat Normal Editions print workshop at Illinois State University. Finch provided contracts for three of those images,\nEarth and Wind\n,\nFire and Water\n, and\nUntitled\n. They explain the exact colors used, the run of the prints, and other identifying information. To read the contract for\nEarth and Wind\n,\nclick here\n.

We’ll just sort of ask you some questions and see where the discussion goes. I know Marvin has some particular questions about specifically the material we received in the Wojnarowicz papers that Aperture had some hand in organizing.\nMH:\tSure.\nDK:\tBut we’ll start first with your general exposure to Wojnarowicz. When did you first learn of his work? Can you describe some of your earliest encounters?\nMH:\tSure. In case I don’t remember well, I did write a little bit about this, I think, in the preface to the new book. But I was working at Artforum and I was fact checking and doing basically everything an editorial assistant does, and I must have been picking up some images. I mean, I’d been to Gracie Mansion, so I had seen David’s work, but everything to me was so overwhelming at the time that I knew that I took it in but that was probably it. And then I went when I was picking up the work – you’d have to check , because I think I looked to see what year it would have been then, but it wasn’t David’s work, it was somebody else’s work, and they were mounting a show, so his work was all over the floor. And it was one of those things where I was all alone in the gallery; it must have been a Monday. So I was by myself, or maybe it wasn’t, but they were installing, so the gallery was closed. And his work was just everywhere. And it wasn’t hung yet, I don’t think. And there was a lot of it. It wasn’t obviously a retrospective, he was still very much alive, but there was a great deal of work. And it was one of those moments when it was kind of quiet and nobody knew I was there yet, and I just had this moment where I could sit and look at each one very slowly. Which would never have been the case going to the East Village to look at galleries, because there were tons of people and the spaces were generally fairly small, and I just never would have had the intimacy. And seeing David’s work in an intimate way is really different. You see it very graphically. When you are there with a group of people, the colors are extraordinary, the design aspect of it or the composition is great, but you don’t get to sit and really read it when the work has text in it, and you don’t get to contemplate it in the same way. But having the privilege of being alone in a room with lots of it was extraordinary, and unexpected. I mean, I just thought I was picking up slides of somebody else. I had no idea I was going to see Wojnarowicz. And I don’t know how long I spent there, but it was a really long time, and I looked at all of it carefully. And then I went back to Artforum and Ida Panicelli was the editor by then, so it would have been late ’88 and ’89 that this happened. And I said, ‘You guys, you have to see this. You absolutely have to go and look at this work. We have to cover this show.’ And they did. They gave him the cover, and they did a beautiful piece, and that was certainly the first time that I really thought, ‘Oh my god; this artist is extraordinary.’ Everything about it is extraordinary, the way he works with whatever media he’s working with, his language. David as a writer is unbelievable. The politics and the social issues that he’s embracing, the sexuality, the intimacy, the sort of just raw aspect of it, everything about it kind of blew my mind. So that was the first moment that I really got overwhelmed.\t\t[3:45]\nDK:\tAnd in that work I’m assuming you were seeing work that was combining photography, painting, text.\nMH:\tIt must have been. To be honest with you, I’m sure it was because David always used all of these or most often used all of these media, so let’s say yes, but I’m not certain. It was the total package of this that made it so interesting to me. I just had never seen anything like this. And I’m someone who’s old fashioned enough, maybe, who still wants to feel something when I look at art. I don’t want it to be all in my head. My head is really active. I can kill myself with it; I can’t stop thinking sometimes. So I don’t want it to be all in my mind. I really want to be overwhelmed viscerally, visually, whatever, and that’s what happened with David. It just swept me away. I mean it literally took my breath away, and there are very few moments that that has happened to me, and that was one of them. I couldn’t believe it. I hadn’t met him yet. I also really loved him when I met him, but that hadn’t happened yet.\t\t\t[4:54]\nDK:\tSo that was the next question. When did you first meet Wojnarowicz?\nMH:\tProbably when we were doing that piece because I was fact-checking everything, and I would have been\nDK:\tFor Artforum, for a story?\nMH:\tYes. So I would have been fact checking that and I would have at least spoken with him then. And my guess is I probably met him then, because we were picking up work. And that show, I should say, was at PPOW, if I didn’t say that. That one wasn’t at Gracie Mansion. It was in Soho, and it was, I think, when PPOW was in Soho.\nDK:\tIt must have been, it sounds like time-wise, it may have been In the Shadow of Forward Motion, his PPOW exhibition in 1989.\nMH:\tIt might have been. I really did try to look this up, and I just don’t recall it because I didn’t re-read what I wrote, but if you guys look it up it’ll say, or Wendy or somebody can tell you.\nDK:\tOkay. So you said when you were picking up work, were you picking up slides from him, or?\nMH:\tOh, you mean when I first met him?\nDK:\tYeah.\nMH:\tThat part I don’t remember. I know I was fact checking with him. I probably was picking up work mostly from PPOW. But at some point I’m sure that I met him, and I can’t remember whether it was, maybe I did pick up something form him, maybe he came in to Artforum; artists often did at the time, especially for fact checking and sometimes it was nicer if they were in New York to try to do certain things in person. So he might have come in. But I can’t give you the visual on that, but I’m just figuring that’s when I met him.\nDK:\tThen how did the relationship progress from there?\t\t\t\t[6:20]\nMH:\tOh gosh, I guess, I should say I liked him immediately. David was exactly the kind of human being that I like. He was very intense, he was very smart. He actually had a great sense of humor, which one doesn’t always pick up on with some of the things that have been written about him, but he could be extremely funny. Not in a slapstick-y way, but in a kind of a very droll way. And he was so intense, and things mattered so much to him. So I think what happened was, I, well, I know it happened, I left Artforum and I went to Aperture. And at that point, at some point right when I started, they were really late, as always, on issues. [they laugh] I think there was an issue of the magazine that was maybe six months late; there was a problem. So I had this idea for an issue of the magazine that essentially was going to be about the culture wars that were going on then. I mean, this would have been, I got there probably in ’89, the fall of ’89, so this would have been then into 1990. The Mapplethorpe trial had happened in Cincinnati, and I think that it was right – I can’t remember the timing exactly, but it’s ballpark in this year, when Donald Wildmon did his nonsense with David. And so I decided I wanted to do an issue of the magazine on all of this, that became known as, the title of the issue, because we titled issues then, was “The Body in Question”. And it wasn’t just about HIV AIDS, it wasn’t about censorship only, it was about all of these issues that relate to the body. So it was about battered women, it was about all kinds of projects. I published Sally Mann and Sally’s photograph of Virginia at Four was on the cover, which caused us a whole other set of problems. But I think that that was when I first really worked with David, because I knew what was going on with Wildmon. I wanted to publish his Sex series, which I thought was unbelievable. It just was so formidable, the way he was working, again, both compositionally in terms of the text; and he had guts. I mean, he was just a really brave artist, and you couldn’t look at one of his works and walk away the same. So we were publishing that, I got David Cole to write, and Cole is – are you going to talk to Cole for this? Because he’s an amazing person; you should talk to him. Because he’s the one who represented David, all pro bono. He’s a lawyer; he’s at Georgetown. And he represented David pro bono in his lawsuit when he was suing Donald Wildmon, but also the NEA four, so, Karen Finley and the other performance artists when they lost their NEA grants. This is a really decent human being who has – I mean, he’s done a lot of work on the Patriot Act and all of these things. That’s his skill set, well, I don’t want to say that’s his skill set; all of this is his skill set. I guess he’s a constitutional lawyer, but these things matter to him, and the First Amendment really matters to him. And he’s an exceptional person and probably worth speaking with.\nDK:\tThat’s a great idea; yes, we’ll add him to our list.\t\t\t\t\t[9:42]\nMH:\tBecause it’s a whole other way into it for you, you know? So he sued Wildmon on behalf of David, and they won. I think David got a dollar. But at any rate, so I had that text, and as we did the Sex Series, and then I asked David to perform. Because I guess the other thing is, I suppose I had seen him perform before I met him, so I had a visual on him, because I was watching a lot of performance work then. I don’t remember if I saw him at a club or whether I saw him at a performance venue, but\nDK:\tMaybe The Kitchen?\nMH:\tFor sure I saw him at The Kitchen, and I’m just trying to think if I also saw him at any clubs. I saw Karen Finely a number of times at the Pyramid Club, I guess, but I don’t think David I saw there. I must have seen him at The Kitchen, and then later, of course, at PS 122. But I had seen him perform, and he was so great. So Aperture was still on 23rd Street then in this kind of funky little brownstone, and we did an exhibition for The Body in Question, and I asked David to do a performance, which he did. We had people lined up around the block. It was incredible – that wasn’t our normal draw. [laughs] So, it was really great. And that was before we ended up – then we did an issue, but that was later, I mean, an issue of the magazine.\nDK:\tWhat was the performance? What was the content of the performance?\t\t[11:12]\nMH:\tI don’t remember what he read, I’m sorry. And we unfortunately never recorded it, because it was when we were doing the Brush Fires, I was looking to see if anybody -- I mean, it wasn’t the moment where every single person walked around with a video camera. [they laugh] So, and then I thought maybe we had recorded it, but we hadn’t. But whatever it was, it was just him at a podium, and he read, and he just riveted the entire audience. He was a hypnotic reader. And he had this very -- I mean, you know, he was just very – charismatic presence. He was very tall, he was very lanky, he had these big two front teeth like I do [they laugh] – but you notice them. And he read so wonderfully. He wasn’t a crescendo reader. It wasn’t like a dramatic rendering. He just read, but he had this intensity that you just could not escape it. You couldn’t remove your eyes. You couldn’t space out. You couldn’t so anything that most people do at some point when they’re listening to somebody read or watching a performance. You just were absolutely fascinated by him. And this is a guy behind a podium in a t-shirt. So it wasn’t like he was – there were no special effects. David was a special effect. So that happened. And then, well, here, let me ask, you may have other questions, so I don’t want to\t\t\t[12:47]\nDK:\tOh no, we’re sort of leading into where I think the discussion was going, which is talking through the process of putting together the Brush Fires issue, from its genesis.\nMH:\tWell that, what happened was, we did that and Michael Hoffman, who was\nDK:\tYou did The Body in Question.\nMH:\tWe did The Body in Question, David did his reading, and Michael Hoffman, who was the editor in chief of Aperture then and the publisher, and probably the only reason we existed, had not known David’s work. And when I brought it in for him to see for The Body in Question, because everything had to be run by him – not from a censorious point of view. It was never going to be about content; it was whether or not he thought it was good, which had nothing to do with whether or not it was problematic or controversial or provocative or anything, but was it worthy of being in Aperture. And he was absolutely undone by David’s work. And that was fantastic for me because I had never been able to undo him about anything. [DK and MT laugh] So for me to both show him something he’d not seen before and also have that kind of reaction, was really cool, I just have to say. And part of it was because David wasn’t in any way part of the photographic realm or circle. He just wasn’t. He was using photography. Photography at that point was much, I’m going to say straighter, but I don’t mean it in a particular – it just was very much about a kind of celebration of the f-stop, or something. I don’t mean to be so snide, but it didn’t embrace as much as it does now. It just didn’t.\nDK:\tSure. Well, it had taken a long time to even get to that point with the embrace of photography as a fine art.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[14:30]\nMH:\tRight; it was just being embraced at that level, and then, all of a sudden there was this work that used photography, like the way Martha Rosler or somebody uses photography. But my god; he used paint; he used type; he used all kinds of stuff! And sp was that was something that Aperture had done – not David’s work; they hadn’t published his work before. But they had done a few things here and there, because Aperture wasn’t, despite the fact that they were founded in a very purist way by photographers, they had always been – because that’s what existed then. But they had shown people like Frederick Sommer, and they’d shown Joel-Peter Witkin, so they were not adverse to showing work that didn’t fit a very kind of conservative definition of what constituted photography. So there were no issues there. But still, it was kind of ground-breaking for us at some level. All of it. So what happened was, at that time Aperture was doing -- it’s a quarterly magazine, and it did three different kinds of issues, mostly. It did monographic issues because it was founded that way. It was founded by a group of photographers, and so many of the first issues they did were about individuals’ work. They were done as magazines because they could sort of disseminate it to a broader group. It wasn’t a big, heavy, thick book. It was just different. Aperture was founded as a quarterly magazine. It became a book publisher, but not at first. And so this was a way of sharing work with each other. And so many of the early issues were monographs, and so Aperture kept that tradition, then other issues were usually about the photography of a particular place or ethnic group. And then, it was thematic, so The Body in Question would have represented a theme issue; a monograph is a monograph. And we did something on Native American photography, and we did something on photography from Germany, so those were other kinds of examples. But all of our monographic issues up until that point had been on long-dead photographers, basically. The tradition had started – of course, they had been alive at the time they were doing it, but then when I was there we did Josef Sudek, we did Munkacsi, we did Renger-Patzsch, all excellent photographers, the criteria being that they’d just not been looked at closely enough, or they hadn’t been seen closely enough in the United States, and so to disseminate their work to our audience would be meaningful. But these were sort of long dead, straight, white guys, on some level. And doing very diverse photography. I mean, certainly Munkacsi was very different from Renger-Patzsch. I mean, Munkacsi is the person who led to Avedon, at some level, and it was full of joy. And Sudek was his own Czech guy, and Renger-Patzsch was his own German guy, meaning they all had very diverse sensibilities. So it wasn’t about a common sensibility, but they had always done these monographic issues very historically. And so I proposed to Michael that we do a monographic issue – well no, I’m skipping way ahead. So, sorry. We do The Body in Question (you may want to reorder this when you do your transcript). So we do The Body in Question and then I say I want to do a book on David’s work. And Michael immediately says, go ahead, do it, because he was so blown away by it.\nDK:\tSo he had seen work in the Sex Series?\nMH:\tHe had seen the Sex Series. He had seen\nDK:\tPhoto text pieces?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[18:15]\nMH:\tWhatever was in The Body in Question he had seen, and then he had seen some other work, too. I would have shown him a lot of work. At that point it might have been the exhibition catalogue from Normal, Illinois, was probably published, Tongues of Flame. So I probably showed him that, or maybe I borrowed work form PPOW. But it took no convincing. Based on what he saw and based on hearing David read, and based on the things that Michael believed in, it was the quickest yes I probably had ever gotten. So that was great, and I probably called up David about it, and he was really interested in the idea. Because he liked the idea; photography interested him. You know, Peter Hujar had been his lover and had been an incredible mentor to him. And he liked the idea. I mean, I hate the idea of speaking for him, but my sense was, at least, that he liked the idea that somebody from the photography world was taking him seriously. Now I guess I wasn’t exactly from the photography world. I came from Artforum and I was writing about dance and performance art, so my being at Aperture was already kind of quirky enough at some level. But I had the support of Michael, because in some ways he was always of the photography world but he was interested in photography as a vehicle to get you somewhere else. It wasn’t just ending and beginning with the photograph; it was about how you could be moved or transported or what you could learn, or whatever, with all of your body, not just your mind. So I talked to David about doing the book. He loved the idea, so that was not a problem. And I wanted to talk to him more, but then he went into the hospital; David did. And he had been in the hospital several times, and I had had several friends who were HIV positive, so I understood that somebody could go into the hospital and come out of the hospital. I preface this just by saying, because then I went to see him in the hospital, which maybe would sound weird but it just wasn’t, because he wanted to work and he wanted to think about projects. And he was in there for a while, but he was getting whatever treatment he needed, it seemed, and he was perfectly cogent and thinking like himself. He was a little drugged so he got tired, but other than that, he was fine, and it was okay to do. I’m saying it now because it probably sounds weird to go to talk to somebody in a hospital about a book and their contract, but that’s what we did. And Tom Rauffenbart was there, who was his partner. Tom, I think, was a social worker at the time. He didn’t have any engagement, to his absolute joy, I think, with the art world. But he was there, and he was lovely. And so I spoke with David and it was all good. He wanted to do it. He wanted me to ask Jean Foos to design it. Jean was a painter. She wasn’t a designer per se, but she had designed Tongues of Flame and he thought that – at that time, Aperture had all different kind – we had an in-house designer but we had several designers that we worked with, and it was fine to work with somebody new, and it was better from my perspective to work with somebody with whom I thought the artist would collaborate and appreciate. I saw no reason for there to be tension. Some people like tension; they think it builds to something else. Maybe, but it’s not my thing. So he wanted Jean and he wanted Lucy Lippard to write the introduction. Because I asked him about that. I said, we want one principle text; who would you like to do it? And it was Lucy, which was really interesting because Lucy I don’t think had ever written on him then, I mean in fact, I’m pretty sure she hadn’t.\nDK:\tHad the Art in America piece already come out? She wrote a cover story for Art in America.\nMH:\tOh, maybe.\nDK:\tShe interviewed him first. I assumed, I had seen that note before and I assumed because was pleased with that piece.\nMH:\tYou’re probably right. Just check the timing on this. I probably was talking to David about this in ’91, I’m guessing. And you’re probably right because he would have had to have some reason for wanting her. But it was still an interesting choice. There were a lot of people that were writing about the issues that he was engaged with, and she wasn’t so much. She’s a marvelous writer, but it was just – so I was thrilled. I actually love Lucy’s writing and I had read her a lot, I think on earthworks, probably, and all. Marvin told me also if I say anything that seems off or wrong – because I’m trying to remember all of this now. So that was it. So Jean was going to design it, and Lucy was going to write the principle text, and David would write something, and then we would all work together on this book. I really wanted to collaborate with him because I just thought – I actually was really looking forward to getting to know him better because I just thought he was brilliant and interesting. Unfortunately, then he died. I can’t remember whether he got out of the hospital and then went back into the hospital, but it was, I don’t even know that we – we must have signed the contract. Yes, we must have, because I think he signed it from his hospital bed or something, and Tom was there, because I would have brought him the contract to sign. But we never got to work together. But we did get to have at least that initial discussion. So he dies, and I’m going to follow everything he wanted. I write to Jean about designing it, I write to Lucy about doing this. But then two things happened. One is, I talked to Michael – this goes back to where we were before – and I say, ‘Look. We’ve always done these monographic issues on long-dead photographers. I would like to do one on David because I think it’s really important.’ And I can remember this, he looked at me and he said, ‘Look. You’re going to lose a lot of your subscribers if you do something on David, but,’ he goes, ‘I’ll support you. So if you want to do it, do it.’ And so we did. And just to get to the subscriber thing because it’s a quick footnote to this, we of course had subscribers who just really couldn’t deal with the material of David’s work. And they were mostly from the Bible Belt. We always knew who was writing; it was the same people who wrote me when I published Sally Mann. They didn’t like nudity in children. They were fine, by the way, with female nudity. So, boobs were fine, breasts were fine. They didn’t like nudity in children. They didn’t like any kind of sex. And they really had a problem with anything that was homosexual. They didn’t want to look at penises, and they didn’t want any kind of suggestion of gay sex. And so that was that. But I would say that I got an equal amount of letters that said this is not photography. This being the Aperture audience, it was kind of like, “There’s paint! [they laugh] There’s text!” And so that was really interesting. Basically, and it’s always been this way, everybody who writes to me or – I’m no longer the editor-in-chief of the magazine, but in the period in which I was, or at that time when I was the editor of certain issues of the magazine where we had different editors, I would always write back to everybody who wrote to me. Unless they were really nasty. There were a couple of letters which were basically, ‘You’re going to burn in hell.’ All right, I’m probably not going to write to that person because it would be like writing Donald Trump; I mean, what’s the point? [they laugh] But basically anybody who’s grappling with it, either from the photographic end or from the content end, I will talk to. And usually they are so shocked because they never – and this is pre e-mail, so you have to know that if somebody writes a letter, this is a different kind of effort. They’re sitting there, they’re typing it up or handwriting it, they’re finding an envelope, they’re figuring out, they’re getting themselves a stamp, they’re finding out how to address it. I know this sounds quaint, but it’s an incredibly different effort than sending an e-mail to a Web site. And so you know if they write, and they’re not saying I’m going to never subscribe to you again and you’re sick and burn in hell – as I said, that kind of stuff, why bother? But everybody else I got back to, and that was a really interesting process, and it’s always been an interesting process. So we did David, so we probably lost some subscribers, and I think we probably gained others, so, I don’t think there was any great loss. But I have to say that Aperture, and we don’t always do everything right, but on the level of having courage at certain moments in our history, we’ve had it. We had it when we published Nan Goldin’s Ballad of Sexual Dependency. We had it when we did Sally Mann’s Immediate Family. We had it when we did Diane Arbus’s book when MoMA wouldn’t do it. And we had it when we did David Wojnarowicz. So, three women in that group, and David. And I don’t think any other publisher, especially a commercial publisher, would have done this. Because also removing it from an exhibition was very different, too. And you know, Barry, they had so many problems in Illinois, and he was courageous. Basically at that time, anybody who decided to do this was saying: I don’t care; I believe in this. And I don’t care if I lose subscribers or if I lose my funding. Because what you have to remember is, all of this stuff had a – oh god, there’s a word for it. It wasn’t just about losing funding. So what happened with somebody like Karen Finley, people got afraid to produce her. It wasn’t just like oh, she lost her grant. It was, oh, we’d better not produce her because we’re going to lose our grants. So there was a chilling effect that all of this had, so there was this collateral damage to this kind of censorship that could be very prohibitive and made life for the artists very difficult because other people might worry too much. So for me, it’s one of the reasons I’ve been at Aperture in various degrees for so long, because I just thought, this is great; they believe in something and they’ll stand by it. So we did David’s work as an issue of the magazine, and what I decided to do then, because he had just died, was to bring in many of the people who were in his circle at the time, like Karen Finley, like Vince Aletti, Nan Goldin, Fran Lebowitz, and some others, so that they could have the chance to essentially grieve through this issue of the magazine. The timing was such that it is the weirdest issue that I have ever done, at some level, because I was asking people to write about David at this moment where they were still grieving. It wasn’t the shock of his death any more, and I think people were shocked. It wasn’t -- people at that point who got AIDS weren’t really living. The cocktails weren’t as effective then. And so, people who were HIV positive, at some point obviously lived wonderful lives. But at that point, if they came down with AIDS it was very unlikely that they were going to survive it. And David had AIDS. And so I don’t think that people were shocked that he died, but they were shocked that he died way sooner than anybody thought he was going to. Because I think everybody just assumed he was going to survive this moment in the hospital and have – and I shouldn’t really say that. Maybe I just assumed it, but people seemed shocked. So it was catching people at this moment of maybe just having gotten over their shock at his death, but they were still mourning him and they were trying to process it and digest it in whatever way you do it. So the texts for this issue of the magazine were really raw and visceral. They were very beautiful. They weren’t remotely academic; even Lucy’s text wasn’t. And it was more so than some of the others, but because she was always going to write that way. I mean, she’s not an academic writer, so I don’t mean that in a pejorative way, but she was trying not to be so overwhelmed by emotion, let’s say; she was doing what we had asked her to do. Before he had died, we had already asked her, and then all of a sudden she was writing about someone who had died. And then all of these people were, who were close to him. So that’s pretty much what happened, and we published the issue of the magazine, and we published it as a trade book as well, which is just what Aperture did at the time. When we did these monographs, we would make it available to the trade so that we reached that audience. Aperture has always been primarily subscriber based, so that you had your subscribers who would get the magazine, and then if you wanted – sometimes we were in some bookstores, but not so much. So if you wanted to make it available to a larger public you would do it as a trade book. So we didn’t do it with every issue of the magazine, but almost all of the monographic ones; so we did it with David’s, too. And they’re pretty much the same. There was nothing that was taken out. The cover is maybe slightly different, but that’s about it. Same image but just slightly different design, because the trade book would have been hard cover and had a jacket, so flaps and all that.\nDK:\tAnd Jean Foos did design it?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[32:25]\nMH:\tDid the whole thing. She did not do the covers. And that’s something that we and other publishers sometimes do. She had the opportunity to do the covers, but we somehow didn’t get to a place that everybody had approved. I think she must have had the opportunity; we never would have not given it to her. Maybe she might not have wanted to. I don’t remember. But if she’d wanted it she would have had the opportunity to do the covers. So then we went to Peter Bradford who did many of our cover designs. He did Sally Mann’s for Immediate Family. He did __[32:58] He just did a lot at the time, because it’s kind of a different skill, and he did that for David.\nDK:\tSo you’ve already talked about how this issue then was performing a number of different functions beyond what a typical monographic text on a photographer might do.\nMH:\tI can’t say it was so conscious, just to be really clear. I think I was mourning too, so it was kind of – I don’t “think,” I know I was. And I wasn’t that close to him. I just really liked him. But it wasn’t that I knew him so well. It was easy; we got along well. But I hadn’t spent tons of time with him or anything like that. But I had so wanted to work with him on this, and then, I couldn’t. And I was really upset. I was saddened by that, you know. So I wanted to say that it was much more of an emotional decision than it was a pragmatic or intellectual decision. I just felt like David had spoken all the time to an idea of community, or he used the word “tribe” often in his writing. And I thought that it was important to embrace that community in what we were about to do. But it was from that. It was very much a heart decision as opposed to a mind decision, if that makes sense.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[34:25]\nDK:\tWas that feel incompatible or was there a struggle, or just a decision to forego some of the art historical pressures of a monographic exhibition where you’re putting some form around his photographic practice over time?\nMH:\tI don’t think I thought – I would love to tell you that I was that conscious. I sort of just allowed – I figured: Lucy is brilliant; she writes extraordinarily well; this is what she does; she will take care of that. And I think the rest was, I guess I should say, I had never worked on an artist who died while I was doing something with him or her. And that’s very powerful, especially if they’re a young person. It’s one thing if you’re working with somebody who’s in their 80s or 90s or 100s and all of a sudden they pass away. It’s never okay, I suppose, but it’s different from somebody where, to this day you wonder, what would he have done? How would he have evolved as an artist? What would have happened if he had survived and been living with HIV? What would he be doing with Trump? [they laugh] I can only imagine. We know what he thought about Reagan, so can you imagine, like, Bush, and then Trump? It would have been, oh, my god, fantastic to hear him. So I think that it wasn’t a conscious effort to forego anything. I was trusting Lucy Lippard to be the extraordinary art historian she has always been. And then, I think I was trying to celebrate David. I guess it was just that, or be true to him by bringing a lot of his close friends and colleagues together and giving them a physical space to talk about him in whatever way they wanted to. I guess with Nan Goldin in particular because I knew she had this great interview that Interview had published, and I wanted David’s voice in here, because of course, I had planned on having David’s voice in here, other than in his work. I asked her because that had not been – Interview has a good audience but it certainly had not been seen by the majority, let’s say, of an Aperture audience. I had asked her if we could publish that because they hadn’t published it in whole. That was great, so we had a lot of material that hadn’t been published before. So in the case of Fran Lebowitz, she was much closer, I think, to Peter Hujar. She hadn’t known David so well, although she knew him, but she, first of all, she’s just also a wonderfully funny and smart thinker and writer, but also she could talk about Peter and talk about David through Peter, which was important, I think, at the time. And I just didn’t know. There are people who I asked in this new iteration of the book, which is much more art historical, in a way, even though. So to answer your question, in retrospect, I don’t think the issue failed. I think it was exactly what it needed to be, and it was also a magazine. It was conceived as a magazine issue, which is very different than conceiving a book, even though it ended up as both. But I think it was so of its time that when the idea came of reprinting it, I just felt I needed to add to it. I didn’t replace anything that was in it, but I thought there was a way to rethink it and add to it that would allow it to have the kind of telescopic or whatever, that view from now, so many years later, and to rethink the work. And I gave everybody who wrote for it an opportunity to rethink what they’d written, or add to it. I didn’t really want to delete anything that had been in it, but I was very happy to add to it. So I think that’s when the art historical consciousness and the distance that allows that, I suppose, at least in someone like me, that’s where it kicked in, in what we did a couple of years ago. \t\t[39:00]\nDK:\tSo then, returning to these brief conversations that you had at the very beginning of the project, we’d love to hear as much as you recall from them, particularly if there were discussions around his practice in general, around photography, around Hujar.\nMH:\tThey weren’t those kinds of conversations. You have to remember, he was lying in a hospital bed, and except when I first spoke to him about doing this when he wasn’t, but that was a phone call. It was like, ‘David, we want to do it. Is this something that would interest you?’ “Yes!” So, that was that; okay? And then I think, when I went to see him I was pretty goal oriented because I didn’t want to tire him out. He was on a lot of drugs. He had a lot of visitors. And I had a list of things that I wanted to address because I wanted to and needed to start the process of doing this, and I wanted to do right by him. So it was things like, who do you want to write it? So it was really pragmatic. Who do you want to write it? Who do you want to design it? It was truly that pragmatic. I don’t think – I never made those distinctions that some other people make who are sort of steeped in photography. I couldn’t even imagine doing it. It never occurred to me to be so media-centric. That’s why, later on, when it suddenly embraced everything, it was like, really? This is a big deal? I just didn’t think that way. I guess my interest had been performance art early on because I thought it embraced all of these media in a really new way. This was the early ‘80s, so performance art was on the cusp; it was becoming a medium, in a sense, and it was some marvelous mixture of theater, of painting, of poetry, of dance, of all of these different media. And that interested me. I was much more interested in something that was eclectic than I was in something that could be so easily defined. And with photography, because I had never – I came to Aperture probably because somebody who – and this is probably not so interesting so feel free to delete it, but – you know, somebody who had worked at Artforum told me that there was job opening at Aperture. I’m not sure it ever would have occurred to me to apply for a job there, because I would have thought, well, they’re just about photography. And then Chuck Hagen who had been at Artforum and was now at Aperture, called me up and said there was a job opening. But I knew they had done Eugene Richards’ Exploding Into Life, which was about his wife dying from breast cancer. I knew they had done Eugene Smith’s work. I knew they had done Nan Goldin’s Ballad. I knew that they had taken all of these risks, and I also knew at that point I was never going to be a political organizer but I had these ideas about things that I believed in, which in all sorts of ways I had begun to understand I couldn’t fulfill at Artforum. Plus, I was just ready to grow. So when the idea of Aperture came up and they wanted me, I went there. But it was not because I was in love with photography as a medium. I think photography as a medium can be spectacular, just as dance can be or music can be or any other medium can be when executed innovatively and brilliantly and with guts and poetry and beauty or ugliness but interesting; whatever. But it wasn’t --  there are some people who just swear by a medium, any medium, and that’s just not me.\nDK:\tAnd not Wojnarowicz. [they laugh]\nMH:\tAnd not Wojnarowicz.\nMT:\tNot at all.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[42:50]\nMH:\tSo for me, I didn’t feel like I was breaking ranks or breaking allegiances to embrace somebody like Wojnarowicz; okay? It was a no-brainer for me. It was actually an excuse. I did anything I could at Aperture to embrace other artists. Clemente, I think I found he did something with photographs – we could do a Clemente piece. With David it was like: Oh, thank god, I can do something! Because he’s not really a photographer by a very conservative definition, but it was a way for me to bring in this extraordinary person. Leon Golub I put in a magazine because of the way he worked from photographs. So I was pretty much doing anything I could to bring in other artists who were probably better known for their work in other media, where I could find some link to photography to justify it. And I was never challenged on that, to Aperture’s credit. And so with David, I doubt I had any deep and real conversations with him about photography, because I wouldn’t have felt like I needed to. I loved the way he used photography. He was smart. He was one of the smartest artists I’ve ever dealt with. And he loved the medium in certain ways, but he -- yeah, we probably didn’t talk about it at all. I think I probably spent a lot of time wondering how he was doing, how he was feeling, so I don’t think I had those kinds of conversations with him that probably would benefit our conversation now. I think I dealt with whatever was pragmatic.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[44:35]\nMT:\tI actually have a really specific question about production.\nMH:\tSure.\nMT:\tIn David’s collection, his papers, the photographs were organized, and contact sheets, all organized, and some of them have Aperture numbers on them. So who did that? What did you get from David?\nMH:\tThat’s what I was trying to remember before coming here. I’m sure – you’re talking about contact sheets?\nMT:\tI’m talking about contact sheets. We have, in the collection, we have contact sheets that were in manila envelopes that had Aperture written on them with a number.\nMH:\tI probably looked at those, which I would have gotten from David, or he would have told PPOW to give me.\nMT:\tI see; okay.\nMH:\tSo it would have either been David directly or David allowing, because they also, very respectful of David, so they wouldn’t have given me anything that he didn’t allow. And then we must have marked what we wanted, or David might have, and that’s what I can’t remember. David had never printed up the image that’s on the cover. Oh god, all right, let me back up a little. I’m sorry, I forgot something. So, in ’92, so wait a minute. We had done The Body in Question, and in ’92 David was fine. He was not in the hospital and we were doing, no wait. Let me just try to remember the chronology here. Because the other thing that happened was, when Aperture was doing its 40th anniversary, I wanted David to be a part of that. And David wanted to be, and for that, he wanted to give us a real photograph. And so he printed up, for us, it had never been printed before, that image of his face that’s on the cover of Brush Fires, the face in the dirt. And so that, and I think it’s because of that, that I ended up putting it on the cover of Brush Fires, because I learned that he had printed that up for us. So that is something he probably marked, if it’s that contact sheet, or he might have been marking other ones to try to make prints up to see which he wanted to give us. But I wish I could remember and I just can’t remember if we had contacts. Because I’m guessing, we wouldn’t have published anything he hadn’t approved, because I just don’t do that. So if he -- once David had died, I didn’t take anything that he hadn’t already made into art, that he had sanctioned, because I wouldn’t have. So if it’s that piece or other pieces like it, it’s very likely that he had marked them up with the idea of getting them printed to see which he wanted to give us for our 40th, which would have been published in ’92. So he probably would have been working on it in ’91, I’m guessing. So I forgot about that middle thing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[47: 47]\nDK:\tGary Schneider had mentioned – this makes sense of something he was trying to recall, which is that he remembered bringing a print of the face in the dirt by the hospital, but he said it wasn’t for their monographic issue, he was like: I think it was for another __[48:01]\nMH:\tSo that’s it.\nMT:\tThat’s it.\nMH:\tThe monograph came after. But everything I’ve said about the monograph is true. It’s just that it came after this. So basically, David made this choice. I really wanted to include him in Aperture’s 40th anniversary. I thought that that was really important. Because, you  know; look. It’s also good for Aperture. It’s important to show that Aperture can evolve from something founded by Minor White, Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Barbara Morgan, but a very strong group of photographers. They would have embraced David Wojnarowicz, some of them anyway, I’m sure of. It’s sometimes more curators who make these strange boundaries between mediums and all of this. Artists don’t always do that. I can’t imagine an artist saying, “Oh, well, he’s not a photographer.” I’m sure there’s somebody who would, but I don’t think it would have been those guys. And I thought it was important for Aperture since we’d now worked with David in The Body in Question, so I wanted him to be part of the 40th. And he loved that. I think it was cool for him that I asked him to do that. It was the same with Alfredo Jaar. When I had published Alfredo’s work and I asked -- who also is not known as a photographer. He also is somebody who uses photography, someone whose work I adored, and it was just like David. It was like a way to get somebody in – if there’s a moment of photography, I can bring them in. Also someone who is a very political artist, in a very different way from David but nevertheless. And so that would have been for Aperture’s 40th, which would have been published in ’92.\nDK:\tDid it end up in the 40th?\nMH:\tYes, sure; absolutely. So Gary would have done that, because Gary was printing most things for David at the time. And then after David had died and we were trying to figure out what to put on the cover of Brush Fires, we did that, but it was only working on this new version of Brush Fires that I learned that David had actually made it specifically for us. He told me that he wanted to give me a real photograph, I believe was the language he used. And I was kind of like, you don’t have to, but that was what he wanted to do. So that was fine. And it was actually smart of him. It was strategic. Because in the grouping, it actually works really well. Of course, I ended up putting Rauschenberg on the cover of that, [laughing] but whatever. I like to screw around a little bit. But I think it was only when we were doing this last iteration, the second iteration of Brush Fires that came out a couple of years ago, that Wendy must have told me that David printed that specifically for us, that he had never printed it before. So my guess is that any markings you’re finding on it were not me or Aperture, unless he asked us to pick which one. That might be possible; and I don’t remember. But other than that, it probably was David, or maybe he looked at it and it was Wendy. Have you talked to the PPOW ladies yet?\nDK:\tYes.\nMH:\tOkay, because they could probably answer that better than I can. Or Gary could.\nMT:\tAnd Gary was really helpful. It was fascinating, the things we learned from him.\nMH:\tGary spent much more time with David. I was so peripheral to all of this. I just really liked him and I really believed in his work. And I also on the enlightened self-interest front, really thought that Aperture should go there. You know? Which it did.\t\t\t[51:50]\nDK:\tBut then just returning, making sure we get the information you were interested in for the finding aid materials, because we have, there were 58 manila envelopes that were numbered by Aperture. Were the interior contents numbered as well?\nMT:\tThat I don’t remember; I have to go back and look.\nMH:\tAnd they were all contact sheets? Or they were everything?\nDK:\tContaining negatives and contact sheets.\nMT:\tNegatives and contacts sheets.\nMH:\tWhen we did the first publication, certainly there were no scans yet, because it was before that. So it’s very possible, at that point – we would have wanted a certain quality of something. Some of the slides that the gallery had would not have been – which is normal – reproduction quality. They weren’t using it for that purpose, or it would have been okay for a review small, but not the way -- Aperture really needs good materials because we also print really well. So it’s very possible that those were put together by Wendy or Penny.\nDK:\tThe negatives.\nMH:\tThe negatives and everything, so that we would make great prints or great slides or something to work from.\nDK:\tOkay.\nMH:\tI was about to say, we wouldn’t have had originals, but then at some point – I always hated taking originals because that scared me, taking somebody’s negatives. And I can’t imagine that we would have had David’s negatives. I know at some point when we were working on the second iteration of Brush Fire, so, a couple of years ago, we had some original slides, but we didn’t get those from you, we got those from the gallery, so those probably are not, unless you got things from the gallery after that.\nMT:\tNo.\nMH:\tSo that wouldn’t have been that. And we had some original slides just so we could choose the best one, if we couldn’t get to the work and we had to do something. But for the first book, we would have been working from transparencies when they existed, or slides, and we would have tried to make prints. We would never have taken negatives for the black and white work. Just because we never would have wanted that responsibility. So certainly we would have asked Gary or somebody else to make prints for us, but we never would have sent negatives off to the printer or anything like that. And it’s unlikely that David would have marked up those envelopes at that point, because he had died already by the time we were doing the book. It’s possible, and I just don’t remember, unfortunately, that he started doing an edit and doing that. That’s very possible, because he was working also closely with Jean, and I always gave the artists I was working with an enormous amount of latitude. So I wouldn’t have said, “This is what I want to do.” I would have been waiting to work with him and have him say to me, “This is what I’d like to do,” and then try to have a collaboration with that as the starting point. So it’s possible that he would have been working on it. I can look at the handwriting if you want, and I can certainly tell you – I won’t recognize it necessarily if it’s David or Wendy’s or Penny’s, but I can certainly tell you if it’s mine. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[55:20]\nMT:\tI think that would be helpful, because\nMH:\tIf it’s mine it’s super sloppy.\nMT:\tBecause this is an unresolved issue of provenance in the archive. We just don’t know what it means. So we preserved that order number, because it might at some point have some relevance.\nMH:\tWe should look at it. I mean, we don’t have to do it today but I live close by and I can just stop by. And let’s look at it and let’s have the original Brush Fires next to us, and just see if we can discern any relationship. And if I look at the handwriting, I might be able to tell if it’s – I won’t remember Jean Foos’s handwriting.\nMT:\tI know her handwriting.\nMH:\tYou know her handwriting. You’ll know David’s handwriting.\nMT:\tRight.\nMH:\tDo you know Penny and Wendy’s handwriting?\nMT:\tNo.\nMH:\tSo let me look at it, and then if I don’t recognize it, I would show it to them.\nMT:\tSure.\nMH:\tBecause if it says “Aperture” somebody was doing this. I don’t think it was us because we just, as I said, would have been really hesitant. Because I mean, we were sending this stuff off. We never would have wanted the responsibility for somebody’s original negatives or slides; ever.\nMT:\tIt worries me, having the originals.\t\t\t\t\t\t[56:30]\nMH:\tI’m sure. And so it’s something that we never – it wasn’t something that we asked for; it was something we tried to avoid. But we want a great quality work. And certainly some of these things, I’m sure, had to be printed or gone through.\nMT:\tThat’s fascinating.\nMH:\tBut let’s look at it together. I have to go out of town Wednesday through Labor Day, but then after that I’m around, so, any time you want to. Do you need it before that?\nMT:\tNo.\nMH:\tYou’re sure?\nMT:\tIt would be very helpful.\nMH:\tOkay.  Let’s do that; I’d really like to see it, too. I’d be curious. Because it might also trigger something that I’m not remembering. I never wrote journals; I’m sorry. It would be so good if I had. [MT laughs] I’m sorry if I’m being too vague for you.\nMT:\tNo, not at all.\nDK:\tThis is really great. Thank you so much.\nMH:\tIs there anything else?\nDK:\tJust this also might be included in what wasn’t your interest in the work at the time or in the discussions that you were having at that time because of the larger context and also because of the impact and power of his work, which was the primary focus, I think, for you and for the issues that you put together, but part of what we’re trying to do on the resource is gathering more details around his production process, for the wealth of materials and interviews and recollections that have been recorded is a class of details that has been lost, so if you had any information about equipment or technique or processes in the darkroom.\nMH:\tHave you talked to Vince Aletti at all?\nDK:\tWe haven’t yet. He’s also on our list; we haven’t scheduled him.\nMH:\tVince knew David fairly well and lived very close to where he and Peter Hujar lived, and I think he visited them there, so he probably will have a sense of what was in the studio. I don’t know. I really don’t know. I’m trying to remember if I heard any stories. The other person who actually would know is maybe Marion Scemama.\nMT:\tWe interviewed Marion.\nMH:\tOkay. And did she have any?\nMT:\tShe did. She remembered a fair amount as did James Romberger and Marguerite, because they did a lot of installation work with him.\nMH:\tThey did installations with him. Unfortunately, when I worked -- for The Body in Question, the work was done. I was picking work that I wanted for this, at that point, because it was my theme and I wanted to publish David, and I wanted to, when I knew what was going on with the Sex series, that’s what I was going to publish. I don’t know if I published the whole Sex series; I might not have had room for it. But I published at least three or four, I think, and then one or two other works, like the one with the plant, I think, that’s growing out of the bills and all of that. I’m sorry I don’t recall the name but I can show you; you can look at it. But I would have been picking the work for that because -- he would have given me permission, obviously, but it wouldn’t have been something that he was picking, and we weren’t talking about his production, we were talking about the lawsuit with Donald Wildmon.\nDK:\tRight.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1:00:00]\nMH:\tBy the time we did the 40th anniversary, he had died. Because in my editorial or introduction to that piece, we got the print from him but we had asked each artist to write something about photography, and David had died by then. So I must have been working on that kind of simultaneously as we were beginning to work on Brush Fires. Because he gave us this piece, but he died before he had the chance – he was working on it, he told me, but before he had the chance to write this. So in the editorial I mentioned that, but I didn’t know he had printed the piece for us. So Penny, or Wendy probably even more so, can tell you more about his working process, because they, representing him for so long, probably would know that.\nDK:\tIt’s funny, she also was sort of like, ‘Well, I didn’t really go to the studio much.’ Gary Schneider, too, was like, ‘Oh, I think he used this technique in the darkroom but I can only guess,’ and it wasn’t something that he talked about because it wasn’t something that he cared to talk about, because he had more important things to talk about.\nMH:\tI think David was so content driven, and that’s what I remember talking to him about. It’s much more likely that we would have talked about something that had to do with politics or censorship or AIDS than it is that we would have talked about his process. And that’s probably the kind of person I am, too. It’s what drew me to his work. For me, the process worked. The work was riveting. And I didn’t kind of need to know more, which doesn’t make me the best editor on the planet, by the way. [MT and DK laugh] But I’m just being super honest with you. I just thought it was extraordinary. Now, again, for your readers, they need to be reminded that this is way before computers and Photoshop, so all of these things that they can do so easily on a computer now, however David was doing it, it was labor-intensive. And that’s really important to remind people, because I see when I teach sometimes, that they’re kind of thinking, whether it’s about David or anybody, ‘Well, what’s the big deal?’ You guys, there was a world before Mac. [laughing] So, that’s important.\nDK:\tEven just the trafficking of some of this material back and forth that you’re describing.\nMH:\tOh yeah; it was on foot. [laughing] Let’s just put it that way. As I said, I didn’t even know about his printing this until recently. I don’t know. But David read a lot, he looked a lot. So he would have been interested in every technique imaginable. But he probably, in a utilitarian sort of way, if he thought it would work for him. I don’t know that he would have sat there and wanted to think about pigment, or, maybe he did. I don’t know. I really don’t know. He used it very effectively. He understood color. He understood composition. He understood a lot of things.  He understood the power of juxtapositions. He understood theater, voice. He understood a whole lot. But what he studied and what he did consciously and what was just second nature to him because of his own visual intelligence or visual literacy, I truly don’t know. I’m sorry I can’t tell you more.\nDK:\tThat’s okay. It’s interesting, this is a place where the archive is really interesting, too. Marvin has pointed out, he has lots of sort of experimental prints throughout the collection __[1:04:00], including solarized prints and playing with emulsions, that didn’t end up in the final work, or the exhibited work, as far as we know. So he was clearly doing experimentation.\nMH:\tWhich makes sense. It’s so complicated with an artist like David, because you don’t know what he would have done if he didn’t think his time was running out. Because you had the content, which was so driven by anger, which probably would have been that way whether or not he himself was sick. It was exacerbated, I’m guessing, because he was sick, but I think it would have still – because he was angry about things that had nothing to do with HIV AIDS also. But I don’t know what happens to an individual when they know that they’re on, essentially, borrowed time, and when those experiments happened, and when he just thought he’d better produce, produce, produce, produce, produce. I just don’t know psychologically how that goes, and especially how it is with somebody like David. I didn’t know him well enough to be able to – and even if I did, I’m not sure I would have been able to hazard a guess. Because that’s something, it seems to me, so personal. All I can say is that there was nothing haphazard about his work. That whatever it was he chose to do, he had thought about it, a lot. And so how he got there, I can’t tell you. How many versions of the Sex Series he did before he landed on what he wanted to do; how many different kinds of background landscapes he experimented with before he decided: I want this bridge, I want this forest, whatever; I don’t know. Maybe he tried all kinds of urban and country scapes before landing on this. So that part I don’t know. But there’s not one thing about his work that doesn’t feel deliberate and intentional to me. And that, I think, is partly what makes it so strong; you feel his will, always. And that’s amazing. There’s nothing lazy about it. So it doesn’t surprise me at all to know that there’s all kinds of experiments. Because I think that he didn’t draw attention to his own interest in being an artist, in a sense, but he got it; he knew. He had a lot of friends who were photographers. He had a lot of friends who were artists. He was showing his work. He was working in every medium, pretty much. So something was always going on, and it was intentional, and therefore he must have – this was a smart guy, so he must have been really thinking this through. I’m sorry I can’t tell you how that manifested itself, but I’m sure of it. Because really, the work wouldn’t be strong if he wasn’t – you can have one happy accident but you can’t have a body of work that rests on that.\nDK:\tThank you so much. Are there any other thoughts or things that we missed in our discussion?\nMH:\tI don’t think so, but if you look at the intro that I wrote to the new Brush Fires, I did check the chronology and all of that, then. I was careful about it. So you might want to just have some footnote to this that gives\nDK:\tWe’ll cross-check it.\nMH:\tJust cross check it.\nDK:\tAnd put in parentheses; yes.\nMH:\tBecause I’d like to have it be accurate. And I probably should have re-read it. As I said, I’m working on this book and I just didn’t have the time. But I’d like it to be accurate, so if you just do that it will sort of tell you the correct order of things. The only thing I guess I’d like to add, was how interesting it was to work on the new iteration of this book. Is that interesting for you to hear?\nDK:\tAbsolutely.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1:07:50]\nMH:\tBecause, based on the question you asked earlier, the first iteration was certainly very visual. We thought a lot about it. But it was also exceedingly emotional. This one, because I decided I wanted to rethink -- all of the work that was in the first book is in this one; there’s just more of it. All of the texts that were in the first book are in this one; there’s just more of them. And then there is the sort of more retrospective texts, like the one that you wrote. But I wanted to really rethink how to organize his work. Because also for the first one, I mean for the publication, it was, even though it became a trade book, it was organized as a magazine is organized, not as a book is organized. So you had somebody’s text, and then I picked images that I thought had a correspondence with the text, or maybe they mentioned it specifically, or whatever. So part of it was illustrative, part of it was coexistence, but it was very much conceived as a magazine and it was conceived for this kind of much more vertical, larger format. So when we did this, I decided I wanted to do something really conceiving it as a book, this new iteration, make it more intimate, and rethink the sequencing of the work, not what work was included but how to sequence it. And if you compare the two, they’re really different that way. And it was an education for me and a kind of open sesame to how brilliant David really was as an artist. It’s not that I didn’t know it or doubted it, but he was incredibly consistent. He was extremely deliberate, as I said before. He was doing themes and variations always. He was working on themes endlessly to figure out how they might play out, to think of different ways of manifesting it. And I mean visual themes now. We had worked on his content themes, I think, in the first iteration of this publication, and now I went back in and I let the visuals drive it. I decided, let’s just keep the text and the images much more separate. Let’s not even think about illustration except in a few cases where it makes some sense. But let’s see what happens to this book if we let it be visually driven, which is what we would do with a normal monograph, as opposed to something that was first conceived as a magazine, even though it was a monographic issue of the magazine. If I had just had Lucy’s text, that would have been different. But when you have ten different texts, it’s something else; it’s a different rhythm. And I broke that rhythm for this. And it was really interesting to start putting, like, David’s critters together, or the way David thought about space, or time. And just to begin to think that way and break away from the other themes and think about just what’s relating visually and what’s relating in a kind of esoteric way visually, made me just have – and I always respected him, so it’s hard to say I respected him even more, but I just understood how visually sophisticated he was. And this was a guy who did not live that long, relatively speaking. So you think of – who is it? Mozart died really young; right? So let’s think of him as Mozart. He accomplished so much so well in a very short period of time. And when you begin to kind of suss out his work as a curator or an editor might if they’re only working visually and not thinking only about content, what you get is an extraordinarily coherent and cohesive body of work that really speaks for itself. And it’s not that that surprised me, but it elated me. And I guess that would be the only thing that I’d want to add, because it was a really interesting experience to go back into something so many years later and have this kind of open sesame thing happen.\nDK:\tSort of across years, across media, that consistency of visual language.\t\t[1:12:00]\nMH:\tEverything. And that he had a very, very developed visual language at this very young age and despite the fact that he seemed so driven by content, that what was happening visually was really considered, and it was in no way secondary. It’s just that the content is so overwhelming, you allow the visuals to be the wings that get you there, as opposed to really examining them sometimes in themselves. I’m sure the curator at the Whitney is doing that kind of examination, speaking as someone who is editing a magazine and looking at it in a very different way, and who was blown away by David’s content. Lots of people wrote, and wrote politically. David wrote incredibly well and powerfully, and his delivery method or his package was exceptional. But for me, it started with the content, and then I knew the content was powerful probably because of the way he packaged it, let’s say. When I went in the second iteration and spent time more with the package, I was like, “Oh my god!” And I wasn’t, as I said, surprised, but I was just like getting this incredible second wind of David, and it was wonderful. So there you go.\nMT:\tThank you.\nDK:\tThank you so much.\nMH:\tI’m sorry if I don’t have the answers to all of your questions.\nMT:\tNo one does. [they all laugh]\nMH:\tBut let me know  after Labor Day when it would be a good time for – I’m blocks away. I’m teaching at NYU Wednesday mornings, so it’s really easy.

So you were telling us about your personal relationship with Tom and David.\nGS:\tYeah, Tom and David. I mean, it’s interesting that it was really about us four. And I haven’t seen Tom in a long time. I would love to see him. But it’s funny how those things shift, and he’s now in Inwood and it’s a little tougher.\nDK:\tWhen did you first meet David?\nGS:\tOh my god. I don’t know. I’m now going to be contradicting some of the information in Cynthia’s book. [all laugh] My memory’s not great. And of course, I don’t have John with me, my partner. And he’s got a better memory. I’m not exactly sure when, but it was definitely through Peter Hujar. And Peter was infatuated with him really early, and so I went to some of the early performances of Three Teens Kill 4. Where David was in the back doing, like, graffiti on the backdrops.\nDK:\tCould you tell us more about those performances?\nGS:\tI don’t; I mean, that’s what I remember. [all laugh]\nDK:\tGraffiti using stencils? He talked about\nGS:\tDo you have any of that work?\nMT:\tWe have the stencils, a lot of them.\nGS:\tThe stencils from that.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tBut he also used those around town.\nMT:\tExactly.\nGS:\tThe same stencils. The burning house and the running figure.\nMT:\tAnd the falling man.\nGS:\tFalling man. Oh, so you have the stencils. Ooh; can I change the subject briefly?\nDK:\tSure. Of course.\nGS:\tSorry; I know you have questions. Did you find the negatives?\nMT:\tOh yes.\nGS:\tDo you have the negatives from the Sex Series?\nMT:\tYou know, I’ve never looked. We have the negatives.\nGS:\tThey’re large format, so they’re not like any of his negatives. They would be 8x10. Each one would be the negative, which was a copy negative; that’s what I did in those days. Well, we can talk about it when we get there.\nMT:\tNo, this is important. Let’s.\nGS:\tYeah, because I really would love to locate them, because my entire collection of David’s work, and it’s large-ish, is now a part of the printers proof collection at Harvard University Art Museums. And they’re doing a show in 2018. And if you have the negatives, I’d love to borrow them. Well, they would love to.\nMT:\tI don’t think we do, because I know the negative boxes that we have and they’re all small. I’ve never seen\nGS:\tIt’s all 35 millimeter; right?\nMT:\tYes, exactly.\nGS:\tOh, what a pity.\nMT:\tYeah, because we found the negatives in with the contact sheets in folders that Aperture had labeled.\nGS:\tOh.\nMT:\tSo we had both\nGS:\tWhen did Aperture get hold of them?\nMT:\tWhen they did Brush Fires in the Social Landscape.\nGS:\tThe original one.\nMT:\tRight.\nGS:\tDamn. I wonder of the negatives went to California, because they were going to maybe, they did actually, edition them, with Nash Editions. And nothing sold, so nothing ever was made. I don’t know; it’s worth researching.\nMT:\tYes, absolutely. That’s one for us to actually check in the archive. But I don’t remember ever seeing it.\nGS:\tYes, if you could.\nDK:\tI didn’t see any negatives that size in the finding aids, and that would have been listed. Even if the content wasn’t recorded, the size would have been recorded.\nGS:\tYes; there wouldn’t have been any contact sheets with it.\nDK:\tRight.\nGS:\tThey would just be in 8x10 envelopes.\nMT:\tRight.\nGS:\tOh, what a pity. They’re doing a show of, it’s a series of great authors, but also they’re doing kind of ephemera. It’s sort of a teaching show, and so, we’ll talk about process. And the copy work I did for Sex Series I’m the most proud of, actually, even though I did a lot of copy work for people like Richard Avedon and Francesco Scavullo, people like that. Bob Gober.\nMT:\tI actually have a question about David’s photographs.\nGS:\tOkay, yes, sorry I interrupted.\nMT:\tNo, it’s fine.\nDK:\tThat’s okay; we’ll come back around to everything.\nMT:\tSo we have 5x7s and 8x10s, usually of the same images, and then on occasion, there are large prints.\nGS:\tBy large you mean what? 16x20, right?\nMT:\tYes, exactly. And so, did David print the smaller ones himself?\nGS:\tYes.\nMT:\tAt Peter’s, I’m assuming.\nGS:\tI never printed smaller prints, for him.\nMT:\tOkay.\nGS:\tTwenty by 24 and larger, the Sex Series was 20x24 that he made, which I don’t know how he did it. He sort of probably rocked them in Peter’s 16x20 trays, because he inherited Peter’s loft and darkroom.\nMT:\tRight.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[0:05:05]\nGS:\tIn fact, you probably have, he made this amazing print just after he moved in there. It was a photograph of Peter. It’s actually reproduced in Cindy’s book, of Peter trying on a pair of glasses.\nMT:\tYeah; yeah.\nGS:\tDo you have a print of it?\nMT:\tNot that I know. I don’t know where she got that one. I have not seen it.\nGS:\tI have a copy. I know Lynn Davis had a copy because she donated it to the Peter Hujar thing which is happening now, unfortunately not here but also – it’s kind of interesting what’s happening with you guys, and like, the community of it; right? But it’s at the Morgan, the print, I saw it there. And I thought, oh my god; I thought we had the unique print. It’s not signed. It’s the only, yeah, so it’s not a\nDK:\tAnd he gave it to you and John as a gift after Peter died?\nGS:\tI think he kind of, yeah. Because we weren’t at the funeral, and so. We were in New Mexico, and those days, no one could contact us. So we arrived back to discover Peter had died and the funeral had happened. And between that and the, he had like a wake at the loft, yeah, he came into the lab with that print. Which is really sweet; it was really sweet. So yeah, David was very sensitive that way. I mean, he was very thoughtful. Sorry; I keep diverting.\nMT:\tI was always curious about that, if David actually printed the smaller ones, because I assumed that he did.\nGS:\tYes, he did. He did.\nMT:\tAnd there are solarized images, as well.\nGS:\tReally?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tOh my god; I would love to see some.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tI thought he was a great printer, by the way.\nMT:\tAnd he played around with emulsions on some of them, too; experimenting.\nGS:\tReally?\nMT:\tAnd so, yeah, it’s interesting to just look through the binders. We have, I think, 5,000 prints or something like that.\nGS:\tOh my god! Oh, so he loved the darkroom.\nMT:\tIt seems; yeah.\nGS:\tBut do you think all of these prints were made after he inherited the loft from Peter?\nMT:\tI don’t know because there are a lot of Rimbaud photographs.\nGS:\tThere are?\nMT:\tBecause he never really put that together in a systematic way. And then people afterward have tried to being all of them together. And I think that, was it Roth? I’ve forgotten his first name.\nGS:\tYeah, yeah, yeah; Andrew.\nMT:\tAndrew.\nGS:\tHe did a book.\nMT:\tHe did the book; it’s pretty good.\nGS:\tAnd then he printed a lot. And I didn’t print those. I mean, they came to me like, gave me like a week’s warning. So I didn’t get to print those.\nMT:\tBut there’s a lot of material that’s never been seen, within the collection.\nGS:\tWow. And the Whitney hasn’t come – [laughing] this is all being recorded.\nMT:\tWe’re working together with them on the show.\nGS:\tYou are. So might they borrow some of these Rimbaud?\nMT:\tI don’t think they’re going to show any of the archival material. They asked us to do a show at the same time.\nGS:\tWill you?\nMT:\tYes. And so I’ve hired a curator.\nGS:\tSo that’s very good; at Grey.\nMT:\tNo, here.\nGS:\tYou have a gallery now.\nMT:\tA little gallery, yes.\nGS:\tOh yeah, you do.\nMT:\tYes. Grey’s already booked for that time, and so.\nGS:\tBut it’s kind of nice here because you can do some programming around it maybe.\nMT:\tExactly.\nGS:\tThat could be really interesting.\nMT:\tAdam said, when they moved downtown, that he was going to do more with us. And they’ve kept their word. So I’ve spoken there a couple of times. It’s nice, because we share a lot of similar interests, and so it’s nice to have them back downtown.\nGS:\tIt’s that sort of ‘80s, ‘90s community that everybody is sort of – I mean, I think that’s why this collection went to Harvard, is that it kind of does, it sort of spans an interesting community.\nMT:\tAnd it’s a period that people are now paying a lot of attention to.\nGS:\tWell, it was a weirdly changing cultural moment for America; right? Very interesting. Messy.\nMT:\tMm-hm. [all laugh]\nGS:\tI know; it’s not easy. It’s not an easy one to untangle. It’s not untangle-able. It’s always sad when a curator tries to, because, why bother? Just kind of present it.\nMT:\tRight. Just let it be a mess.\nGS:\tLet it be a mess.\nMT:\tBecause it really was. And a lot of the work is very messy. Which I love.\nGS:\tYeah. I love that, too. There are sort of weirdly unresolved edges to it.\nMT:\tYes; David’s work especially.\nGS:\tEspecially.\nMT:\tBut I’m talking too much. You have the questions.\nDK:\tNo, that actually brought us to the idea that Wojnarowicz started working in the darkroom for the first time himself after he moved into Hujar’s loft.\t\t\t\t[9:53]\nGS:\tNo, that’s not true, I discovered, because he actually did study photography. So like, as far as I can tell, and I’m not an expert on his history; right? Because you don’t have these kind of conversations exactly. I mean, the photos that he used in paintings before he inherited Peter’s darkroom were very scrappy prints; right? And I never made any of those for him. But I did processing for him. He came into the lab and then did a lot of film processing. And then, he wasn’t printing those things, as far as I know. Although maybe you can tell me something else. Because if Tom has kept all of these things together rather than sell them, which is interesting that he did that; that’s really sweet. Where did he print them? Do you know?\nDK:\tI think that’s then a big mystery, because at least according to Cindy Carr, that was when he began using the darkroom, regularly at least.\nGS:\tYes.\nDK:\tPerhaps it may have been that he\nGS:\tOh yeah but no, but that’s when he started showing photos as themselves. He didn’t show photos before. Did he show the Rimbaud? Do we have history of him having exhibited the Rimbaud prints?\n[1]\nDK:\tI don’t believe so. I believe after he moved into Hujar’s loft he reprinted that series and showed them for the first time.\nGS:\tNow I printed a few, but I think I printed them posthumously. I’m not sure if they’re signed.\nMT:\tThe appeared in ’81? It could be ’83, in Soho Weekly News. There’s an issue of Soho Weekly News.\nGS:\tOh. Of how many images?\nMT:\tI don’t remember.\nGS:\tDo you have a copy?\nMT:\tWe have a copy of it, because people are always coming in to look at it because it is the first appearance of the Rimbaud images in print.\nDK:\tI think that was, just another citation in, I believe it’s Fire in My Belly, that they hadn’t been shown in a gallery, perhaps, and he showed them for the first time, so it would have been in ’88 or something, maybe, at PPOW.\nGS:\tSo there must be, because my prints, I never noticed which things are posthumous. I think they were. They were only a few, though, shown. Right? Do we know? Do they have the checklist, PPOW?\nDK:\tWe have a bunch of their checklists. I’ll check that.\nGS:\tYeah. Okay. So he came to me to print those. I don’t know why. Maybe he never exhibited his prints. Maybe he wanted me to make the prints for exhibition. That did happen sometimes.\nDK:\tSo, even at smaller sizes he would have you make prints for exhibitions?\nGS:\tYes, because he, for example, when I printed the Buffaloes, he had already made the 16x20 edition, actually, that, Penny has one of the 16x20s. I’m not sure if Tom still has a copy. They’re really beautiful. It’s on Peter’s paper. They’re on Portriga Rapid. They’re gorgeous. And the paper didn’t exist any more, so Peter left a stack of paper.\nMT:\tThat’s really important.\nGS:\tThat’s interesting; right?\nMT:\tYeah, that’s really important for us.\nGS:\tAnd in fact, the portrait of Peter that he printed is also on Portriga Rapid 11x14.\nMT:\tOh, that’s really a wonderful detail.\nGS:\tVery interesting; right?\nMT:\tYes, totally.\nGS:\tIt’s an interesting aspect of this. So there was, you know, David was very much into the meaning of location or the notion of it, so Peter’s paper would have been very, very important to him, that it was Peter’s paper, Peter’s darkroom, Peter’s loft. But he didn’t want me to copy those. He didn’t want me to use them as guides, the buffaloes. When I made the 30x48s, [40x48?] he wanted me to print them without it – he never wanted me to use his prints as guides.\nMT:\tFascinating.\nGS:\tWhich is kind of curious; right?\nMT:\tYes, it is.\nGS:\tIt’s very unusual for an artist.\nMT:\tWell then, because he was so meticulous with other people about everything.\nGS:\tWas he?\nMT:\tYes. That’s what we’ve learned.\nGS:\tHe didn’t just delegate. He delegated with me.\nMT:\tMarion taking the image of his face coming out of the dirt.\nGS:\tMaybe she owns some negatives that are hers, too. Is this true?\nMT:\tI assume. But he was meticulous about every detail of that. And so that’s one of the things she said. We also learned that the blue paint that he used, because one of the things we’re interested in is, as we go forward and doing conservation, what kinds of things do conservators need to know. And it was called Ultima Blue. And it was just a paint that the store nearest his\nGS:\tLike a house paint?\nMT:\tYes. Ultima Blue.\nGS:\tOh. [laughing] He didn’t think about that. I mean, you know.\nMT:\tSo, it’s interesting.\nDK:\tAlso he actually wrote about, in his description of the installation at Mnuchin, he wrote about the symbolism of blue and the healing blue light and the importance of the color blue to the sort of larger symbolism he was working with. So.\t\t\t\t\t[15:10]\nMT:\tAnd that’s something that’s just come out in the work that we’ve done. Nobody’s ever talked about the role that blue played. But it’s there, especially in the painting. It’s so prevalent.\nDK:\tThe question about this initial, whether or not he had maybe done some forays into printing before moving into Hujar’s loft.\nGS:\tI think he had.\nDK:\tHe had the time and the space to do more sustained experimentation at this time.\nGS:\tYes.\nDK:\tAnd I guess in your previous interview with Cindy Carr, you and John had said that you encouraged him in his photographic work at this time.\nGS:\tYes.\nDK:\tSo I was interested to hear more about what that encouragement was like, what those discussions were like, if you talked about what his goals for photography were, or if he had technical questions that you worked with him on.\nGS:\tI don’t think I ever had to do any demonstration for him. I can’t remember, actually. His photography is among his strongest work; isn’t it?\nMT:\tIt is.\nGS:\tWhich is curious. You know. He died so young, and Peter died in ’87; he dies ’92. So there’s that very short period, and he has two exhibitions, right? That include photography, before he died. So, a lot of photography. Oh, I love that you have that; John Erdman; that’s my partner, at the bottom of the Schiller McLoughlin poster. [all laugh] Sorry; I’m sorry. God! You can tell I’m having one of those days! [all laugh] I just noticed it.\nMT:\tThat’s from Ira Silverberg’s collection.\nGS:\tOh, so, his archive is here, too?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tHe’s a neighbor of mine on Long Island. I’ve known Ira, from David, through David, actually, rather than Lynne Tillman. So it’s Ira rather than Lynne’s collection. Where’s Lynne’s archive? Here too? [laughing]\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tOh my god; this really is old home week, isn’t it. It’s extraordinary!\nMT:\tThe home is by John Fekner. And this is a Carl Apfelschnitt.\nGS:\tOh, that’s wonderful.\nMT:\tIt’s High Risk, which was done for that anthology that Ira edited with Amy Scholder.\nGS:\t[laughing] It’s all really a kind of community.\nMT:\tThis is an unfinished Wojnarowicz.\nGS:\tIs it really? What was he thinking? It’s like, oh, that’s so curious. I would never have guessed that. Maybe it’s sort of an under thing.\nMT:\tExactly. That’s right. He would have put stuff on top of it.\nGS:\tAn image in the middle of it, like a painting in the middle of it.\nMT:\tRight. But it’s this incredible sense of letterform. Right? It’s really beautiful. And this is from Fashion Moda, it’s the sign from the Bronx.\nGS:\tOh, really? That is kind of extraordinary. When are you going to do like a huge show? That would be really wonderful, on like really strange ephemera; right?\nMT:\tYeah. Dennis’s papers are here, too.\nGS:\tWow.\nMT:\tAnd the most valuable painting in the room is the least interesting; it’s a Duncan Grant.\nGS:\tI don’t even know the work. Weirdly enough. I know the name; I don’t know the work, though.\nMT:\tDuncan Grant is Bloomsbury.\nGS:\tHow come it’s here?\nMT:\tIt was given to one of our collectors who was a close friend of Thornton Wilder, and so that’s how it ended up here.\nGS:\tI should actually keep it focused; I’m so sorry.\t\t\t\t\t[19:00]\nMT:\tSorry.\nGS:\tI know, we have a problem, both of us. [all laugh] And Diana’s not getting what she needs. So, encouraging him in his photography, in a way, since he started exhibiting his photography after Peter died, we would have had a lot of conversations about photography. We would have, I assume.\nDK:\tAbout things like paper and exposure, or more\nGS:\tNo, no; not technically. Just like the meaning of it in the context of his work, I imagine.\nDK:\tAnd so you encouraged him to show it.\nGS:\tBecause the work changed, show to show his work changed quite dramatically, actually. No, he wanted to show it.\nDK:\tOkay.\nGS:\tI mean, he made – what’s amazing about David is, he made those Sex Series montages. They’re technically extraordinary. I mean, they’re very crimped up and everything. Where’s the unique set; do we know who has it?\nMT:\tNo.\nGS:\tPPOW must have that information; no?\nMT:\tI don’t know. We have the mock-ups for a lot of things but not the Sex Series.\nGS:\tBut there were extra prints.\nMT:\tThere were.\nGS:\tThat they also do sell; right? I mean, they have. They have like __[20:25] proofs and things.\nMT:\tOh, they probably do.\nGS:\tThey are proofs; they actually are proofs; right?\nMT:\tYes. We might\nGS:\tI’m dying to see some of them to see how different they are from the actual Sex Series. But if you think about the technical, like, how to work out positive and negative space in them, or even just, when you’re printing from a slide, what does that do? Like, what is that contrast? How does that function? And then to balance it within a composition, right, is kind of extraordinary. I mean they’re technically really kind of amazing.\nDK:\tWell maybe since we’ve circled back to it a couple of times, that’s one of my questions.\nGS:\tI must tell you, of all the work that I made for David, the Sex Series was the most poetic of our relationship, because I could bring this technical thing to it and he had made these, like, masterpieces of the darkroom. Forget about politically, sexually, whatever that was, because I think they’re his most important work, myself personally.\nDK:\tSo then maybe if you could walk us through. Because from my perspective, I have no idea how that montage was put together technically in the darkroom, and then what he did himself in the darkroom and what he brought to you, and then how the artist’s prints were made.\nGS:\tWith the Sex Series.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[22:00]\nDK:\tYes, with the Sex Series, specifically.\nGS:\tOkay, I’m not going to try – I mean, to unpack them, is not -- well, I suppose I could have pulled off something of that technical prowess. But I think he had a kind of systematic mind, and he’d been making these, you know, he’d been making stencils from the beginning. And so it is very much reliant on the kind of negative space of a stencil. Right? And like how a stencil functions, like, what does that mean? How do you cut a stencil in order to have that image on, you know. So it starts with that. There are a lot of cut-outs in it. And then if you look, when there’s a circle, there’s usually a black ring around the circle to kind of in a way control the difference between the held-back light and then to impose light on that. And so it’s a series of stencils. So I’d love to see the proofs to see the screw-ups, to see how he kind of worked out making that final one set that he thought was acceptable. And the one set that I copied, that I re-photographed for him.\nDK:\tSo he brought in a sort of master set that were re-photographed in order to make the\nGS:\tThe 16x20s, the smaller prints. What actually happened, and I think it’s told in Cindy’s book, and now I’m going to forget the sequence without John here. But he was very anxious about giving them up. I think they had, there was so much interest in them, he was going to lose them. You know how that is with a gallery show, it’s like, you know, it can’t be not for sale. I assume that’s what happened. But what I remember is that I suggested to him that I make a copy of two of them in order to make an edition, and if he thought they were good enough, then we would go ahead with all of them, like all eight; right?\nMT:\tThere are a couple of attempts at Sex Series that never were editioned, as well.\nGS:\tWell that’s what I’d love to see.\nMT:\tThere are some others.\nGS:\tI would love to see the sort of attempts, or the earlier versions, like the less complicated versions. Because they have to be states. In a way, they have to be states, because they’re so – some of them are quite simple, but some of them are quite complex. Like the laying down of the text, that’s simple stuff, on top of the image, like burning it through the print, burning the text through or holding it back. But he understood – did he make photograms? In the studio, too? Because it’s sort of understanding of photogram, too. Yeah.\nMT:\tI don’t know what that is.\nGS:\tA photogram is a camera-less print.\nDK:\tSo like an object on top of the exposed paper.\nGS:\tYes; yes. Like Man Ray made or yeah.\nDK:\tYou would think, because there’s something stencil-like about that kind of, but I haven’t seen any. I don’t know if he\nGS:\tThey are kind of – he understood how to make a photogram very well; right? And also really complex moves. Which means, you have to remember all the – it’s very systematic, those. They’re like, huge system there. So they were really extraordinary. He was really happy with the results of the tests, and then I went ahead. So, if you put my 16x20s next to the original set, well, they’re a different size because I told him we would have to do that in order to preserve the uniqueness of the original set. Right? But also in order to make the texts legible in order to separate – so I did a lot of work. And that’s why I would love to get a hold of the negatives, to see what kinds of masks I made to exaggerate certain things, like some text, like some of the parts of the images.\nDK:\tSo that would have been the way that a complex print like that is made, is through techniques like masking, burning.\nGS:\tWell he did masking directly under the enlarger. Right? Like, directly on the print.\nDK:\tOn the print.\nGS:\tYes. On the paper. So he would have a bunch of stencils that he worked with.\nDK:\tThat would create the insets.\nGS:\tCreate the different, like, in order to hold back areas to print something else within that held-back. Because the emulsion is what sticks.\nDK:\tSo I see what you mean by the graduated process.\nGS:\tYes. He’d have to know that in order to, like, put one image next to another image, he’d have to mask out the second go-round, then he’d have to locate that. It’s not so easy. It’s very layered. The Sex Series are really layered.\nDK:\tBut it’s a layer on a single print.\nGS:\tYes; it’s like montaged in the darkroom onto one sheet of photographic paper. What is the date on the Sex Series? Is it like eighty—it’s not late, I don’t think.\n[2]\nDK:\t[laughing] I have the same catalogue in my bag, too.\nGS:\tI’m sorry. I really should have studied; I should have kept my dates. Maybe it’s at the end. Although, we could just Google search it, I suppose; couldn’t we. Oh, you have a hardcover. I never knew there was one.\nDK:\tThis is from the library.\nGS:\tOkay, so they rebound it.\nDK:\tSo they have the illustrations but no – usually the captions appear on the page -- oh here we go, checklist, if he showed them in this.\nMT:\tI want to say it’s ’87.\nGS:\tI think so, because then the show is ’88, isn’t it?\nMT:\t1990.\nGS:\t1990. Oh, okay.  So it was in the – when was that show? Was that show ’91?\nMT:\tThis one?\nGS:\tNo, no, the show at PPOW where they were first shown.\nMT:\tThat I don’t know.\nDK:\t’89.\nMT:\t’89, so it’s wrong in here.\nGS:\tIs the date on them? My god; there’s a discrepancy.\nDK:\tNo, is the PPOW show.\nGS:\tBut they were shown at PPOW while he was alive.\nMT:\tMm-hm.\nGS:\tYes.\nDK:\tIt’s so funny. Everywhere else in the book the captions appear on the facing page. And it’s just for this series – it makes me think that they were ’89 because maybe he was still working on them. Interesting.\nMT:\tWell, this is from MoMA, saying 1990.\nDK:\tOkay.\nGS:\tThe date on them?\nMT:\tYes. But I’ll tell you\nGS:\tMy god; maybe my date is ’90.\nDK:\tThat might be.\nGS:\tThe date for the editioned prints. Maybe.\nDK:\tThat might be.\nMT:\tYes; could be. Because\nGS:\tAnd they must have the 16x20s. Do they have a full set, MoMA?\t\t[30:00]\nMT:\tThat I do not know. These are from Wagstaff’s collection.\nGS:\tOh that’s interesting, too. Wow.\nMT:\tTheirs is 14 7/8 x 17 3/16.\nGS:\tOh, that’s very interesting. So yeah, in order to do that circle, right? He would have had to have\nDK:\tSo he would have masked it on the first exposure.\nGS:\tI don’t know. He could have actually done, he could have done the circle first, of course. I don’t know. [laughing] Right? And then covered it. You know?\nDK:\tThat’s interesting. But it would have been in two exposures.\nGS:\tIn several. Because then, actually, in most of them there’s like a black ring sort of separating the circled image from the ground.\nMT:\tWe have the pornography that he used for these.\nGS:\tOh, you do? They were from Peter’s collection; right?\nMT:\tWere they from Peter’s collection?\nGS:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. Apparently.\nMT:\tThat’s interesting.\nGS:\tI don’t know any of these things.\nMT:\tWell, see, that’s fascinating.\nGS:\tIt’s like, this is interesting stuff.\nMT:\tOne thing that’s never been clear to us, and maybe you know, is, we have books and videos in the collection, but I can’t tell what were Peter’s and what were David’s.\nGS:\tYou mean what was owned by whom.\nMT:\tRight.\nGS:\tOh, that’s interesting.\nMT:\tLike, I have no idea if David was a Maria Callas fan?\nGS:\tNo, it was Peter.\nMT:\tIt was Peter. That’s my hunch, when it’s stuff like that, that it has to be Peter.\nGS:\t[laughing] He was a huge Callas fan. But do you know that Vince Aletti inherited Peter’s books?\nMT:\tHe did? Interesting.\nDK:\tAah.\nGS:\tSo maybe he could help you. Have you interviewed him yet?\nMT:\tNo, we haven’t talked to Vince.\nGS:\tI don’t know if he’s such a David person, exactly.\nMT:\tRight.\nGS:\tBut I think he inherited Peter’s books.\nMT:\tThat’s interesting. Because a lot of the books in David’s collection are source materials.\nGS:\tFor him.\nMT:\tYes. Things that he cut up.\nGS:\tOh really?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tSo they’ve been vandalized.\nMT:\tSome of them.\nGS:\tOh, really? Ooh, that’s so interesting.\nMT:\tAnd then others were ones that he photographed and then used images from.\nGS:\tHe re-photographed from the books.\nMT:\tYes. Meet the Primates, a book about monkeys, where they’re all dressed as humans.\nGS:\tWait a sec, was that one of the images that was going to be, like with text on it, right at the end? Like, When I Put my Hands On.\nMT:\tYeah, that image is from, he broke in\nGS:\tThat’s from a negative, though.\nMT:\tYes. He broke into the Indian burial mounds in Illinois.\nGS:\tWell he told me at the time that you could go in but you weren’t supposed to photograph; right? Is that true?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tThat’s in his memoirs?\nMT:\tAnd he took the – and Barry remembers it. Barry Blinderman’s one of the other people we’ve interviewed. Barry remembers him going out – Barry took him out there.\nGS:\tOh, so he was with him.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tThat is about to leave my hands. I have a print of that one, like with the text, and it’s about to, they’re picking up on Monday for Harvard.\nMT:\tIt’s my favorite of his works.\nGS:\tYes, me too, me too.\nMT:\tIt just rips your heart out; it’s beautiful.\nGS:\tTotally. Because if you think about when it was made and who he – I mean, in a way, Face in the Dirt does that, but that text is just like; oh. I start crying every time I read it.\nMT:\tI get goosebumps.\nGS:\tI get goosebumps, too. It’s amazing. It’s like one of the great texts. Yeah. If you’re gay, [laughing] it’s very moving.\nMT:\tThe One Day This Kid is good, too.\nGS:\tOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I wish I had, actually, I wish they would re-reproduce that thing. I wouldn’t mind living with that. That’s an amazing poster.\nDK:\tThey did another edition in 2012, actually.\nGS:\tThey did?\nDK:\tYes, as a benefit for Printed Matter.\nMT:\tAfter Sandy. I bought one.\t\t\t\t\t\t[34:00]\nGS:\tYou bought one from the Printed Matter thing.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tI wish I had known about that.\n[3]\nMT:\tThey’re small, and they’re letterpress.\nGS:\tOh, they are. How do you read it? And you can read it?\nMT:\tMm-hm.\nGS:\tIt’s readable. Oh, that’s interesting.\nMT:\tSo they set it letterpress, which is interesting. Yeah, I can’t afford the real one.\nGS:\tIs it like it’s very valuable?\nMT:\tDavid’s have gone up in value.\nDK:\tIt’s not a huge edition. It’s a small edition.\nGS:\tOh, it is a small edition?\nDK:\tTen, I think.\nGS:\tBut it’s large, though, isn’t it?\nMT:\tIt is.\nGS:\tSort of a poster size?\nDK:\tYes, 30 by 40, something like that.\nGS:\tReally? It’s that big?\nDK:\tYeah, poster size.\nMT:\tThe Buffaloes, a copy of it sold last summer for $145,000, which is a good price for a Wojnarowicz photo.\nGS:\tI had to sell mine early. [laughing] There are a few Wojnarowicz’s, you know, it’s like he was -- He actually said, he gave me permission to sell it, he said, “Wait until I die before you sell it. Sell things if you need to make ends meet.” And so we had to. So I had a painting of his we sold, one of the big maps with a big head on it and a meteor. That we sold; well, we couldn’t store that any more. That went to a museum; Newark. And then the Buffaloes. [laughing] Because I had a posthumous one. I had the 20x24 that Tom and I put together for a posthumous edition. So that’s going to Harvard, too. So, okay, back to the Sex Series. What else about it? So yes, so he was able to print very complex -- because that’s quite early. Look. He inherited the darkroom, I suppose he inherited it in ’87. And you’re saying it’s either ’89 or ’90, the Sex Series; right?\nDK:\tI think ’88-’89 is stuck in my head, and it might be, I think probably MoMA’s print is maybe printed ’90.\nGS:\tSo yeah; maybe. I don’t know how to look that up exactly. We didn’t keep exactly great records. But actually, if we look – yeah; maybe they’re dated on the print. Anyway. What else about Sex Series?\nDK:\tI guess as long as we’re talking about other text works as well, just to sort of confirm technique, so you were saying that’s a simple technique, that’s just burning out the text in order to add a layer of text directly to the print.\nGS:\tYes. But it could have also been printed with a cel, with just one shot, like an image with a text often would have just been\nDK:\tHe could have re-photogrpahed\nGS:\tWould have just laid it down directly on the paper.\nDK:\tAnd he would have had to have that cel typeset somewhere else?\nGS:\tHe could have just had it either screen printed or, I don’t know, in those days. It could have been printed on cel, no? You could have made a Xerox onto a cel, possibly. I don’t know. I don’t know how the text happened. Do you have any of the cels?\nMT:\tWe may have some of the cels in the oversize material, in the map case. I vaguely remember that there is.\nGS:\tSo the show that happened up at, just happened. It was like a group show that had a valise of David, like one of his cases opened up. [laughing] Tell me the show.\nMT:\tThe show that Julie Ault did.\n[4]\nGS:\tJulie Ault did; yes. Did that come from you, the case? Oh, I see. How many cases like that are there?\nMT:\tWe have only one.\nGS:\tThat one.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tI was like amazed at it.\nMT:\tWe have other objects that didn’t make it into the Magic Box, that he collected.\nGS:\tWhat about the elephant’s skeleton, the baby elephant’s skeleton?\nMT:\tKaren Finley has it.\nGS:\tOh.\nMT:\tHere’s a question. Do you know anything about the child’s skeleton?\nGS:\tNo. [laughter] Tell us about the child’s skeleton. That’s a bit scary.\nMT:\tWell, it appears in some of the photographs. And it’s usually dressed as a child. And there’s a set with Peter and somebody else and David, and they’re out in Jersey. And they’re walking the skeleton around as though it’s a child.\nGS:\tIs it a real skeleton?\nMT:\tIt is.\nGS:\tAre you sure?\nMT:\tOh yes.\nGS:\tIt’s not like a plastic thing.\nMT:\tNo. No.\nGS:\tHow did he find that?\nMT:\tHe bought it in Paris in the ‘70s.\nGS:\tWow.\nMT:\tMarion remembers. There was a shop near her house which is where he purchased it.\nGS:\tThat’s an interesting one.\nMT:\tDeeply problematic for us now, because it’s human remains.\nGS:\tOh, it’s in the collection.\nMT:\tMm-hm. It’s dressed, and it’s in a casket. And he used it in other installations.\nGS:\tDid it live in a casket with him?\nMT:\tYes. He created, I’m sure he made the casket for it.\nGS:\tI wonder if this is sort of influenced by Paul Thek in some real way. You know?\nMT:\tThat’s interesting.\nGS:\tAnd why – god, that’s shocking. Whew! I don’t remember __[39:37] at the time. You know?\nMT:\tHe used it in installations. We have a fair number of bones, actually. But I’m asking everybody about the skeleton thing because nobody remembers.\nGS:\tNo one remembers it? Maybe we all blocked it, because it’s so problematic.\n[5]\nDK:\t__ private __[39:55]\nGS:\tNo but if they walked it around.\nMT:\tRight. And it’s in installation photos.\nGS:\tHe used it in shows?\nMT:\tHe used a lot of skeletons.\nDK:\tAnd it wasn’t the one that was used in the New Museum installation of the Decades, the America: Heads of Family Heads of State, because that one I know he picked up ’89, because he has a note: Go pick up child skeleton. [laughing]\nMT:\tReally?\nDK:\tYeah.\nMT:\tOh, where’s that?\nDK:\tIt’s in the phone logs. I have a scan I’ll send you.\nMT:\tSend that to me.\nDK:\tBut I assumed it was not the one that we talked about as being purchased earlier.\nMT:\tWell, maybe Marion’s wrong.\nDK:\tOkay, yeah, I’ll send you that.\nGS:\tSome people – I mean, I don’t know, I can never remember dates. And I don’t remember names. Was Marion really good at that?\nMT:\tShe remembered some things.\nGS:\tSome people can; some people remember all that. That’s why I always need John with me. He’s very good for remembering dates and all. I don’t remember a child’s skeleton. I would imagine I would remember a child’s skeleton, though.\nDK:\tMaybe going back to When I Put My Hands on Your Body, it’s been written that he had planned two more works in that series.\nGS:\tYes, and in fact, the prints – do you have a copy of the other prints here?\nDK:\tI’m not sure.\nGS:\tBecause Tom did, I did give them to Tom after he had died.\nDK:\tBecause you were in the process of working on those?\nGS:\tYes. And he just couldn’t couple text for those. I had finished printing those because he wanted them all in the last show. And he just was too sick to do it.\nDK:\tBecause he was basically writing the text for it?\nGS:\tWell, he was choosing text. I don’t know if he was writing them. Like, did he write “When I put my hands on your body” specifically for that image, or did he couple it?\nMT:\tI think he wrote it specifically, because there is\nGS:\tWhat about the one with the bound hands?\nMT:\tThere’s a proof of One Day This Kid that has Nan Goldin’s image instead of David’s, from one of her childhood photographs.\nGS:\tReally?\nMT:\tYes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[42:00]\nGS:\tOh that’s really interesting.\nDK:\tHe also had work in progress for One Day This Kid, the text typed out and he’s editing it directly on the paper.\nGS:\tOh, really.\nDK:\tSo even if perhaps it was collaged from an earlier writing, he may have edited it especially for the print.\nGS:\tSo maybe the same thing happened with the skeletons, only because it’s so, the image itself is just so rivetingly intimate, with the couples lying there. It’s a really amazing thing. And there are only three prints of it. Which is bizarre, right? So I don’t think he ever expected it to be like a saleable thing. Was that the last thing I did for him then? Those two. I think the hands came a little bit later than the skeleton. I think the skeleton was the first of those like image-text things.\nDK:\tYes.\nGS:\tThe fall, and then the hands, and then there was one of a parade, and then there was another one. I don’t remember. Like a Chinese parade, I think it was, but I don’t have them, so; not in decades.\nDK:\tAnd had you discussed the work before he brought in the image? Or would the discussion around a work begin usually when he brought in a finished image.\nGS:\tSo, this is the interesting thing with David. He never wanted to bring in an image. He would just have me print it.\nDK:\tOkay. So he’d bring in the negative.\nGS:\tHe’d bring in the negative. Yes. And if I had questions, I would of course call him in. I mean, he was just up the street. But no, he didn’t want to interfere with – it was interesting; it was a unique relationship in that way. Because it was going to be a different size. I’m assuming this. He understood that the translation of the scale would have to happen in the darkroom, and he didn’t want to be in the darkroom with me. Do you know what I mean? He wanted me to do that job. I mean, it’s very flattering. It’s really flattering. Because you said he was very controlling of his other collaborations. Oh really. So you’ve interviewed some of them.\nMT:\tMm-hm.\nGS:\tOh. Hm. Interesting. He wasn’t at all with me. And in fact, with the Buffaloes, I think he was going to just do a small edition, like six or something? What is it? It’s not large. But it’s a very straightforward negative to print; right? And so once I got it I just made more, and so there’s like this edition but there’s a huge number of proofs. __[45:00] [all laughing] It’s kind of interesting because he just liked them all. And he never paid me for anything. He didn’t want money to ever pass between us. He had his very, he had to kind of, you know, psychological reasons for it, whatever. And I didn’t mind, because I loved him so much and I loved the work, so we did just an exchange. It was always just an exchange.\nDK:\tInteresting. So in the way he was hands off, he didn’t express preferences for paper or?\nGS:\tNo. I know you asked that originally.\nDK:\t[laughing] Yeah.\nGS:\tYou know, once I saw the 16x20 Buffaloes, and I’m not quite sure if I saw it before or after I printed the big one, like, I thought, well, I could have done, I could have done, I could have done. Right? Because I printed it on – and actually, once everything is at Harvard, I have a set of prints with one negative by Gilles Peress on, like, it was sort of a competition for Photo District News. But at the back of each of them, I have the name of the paper. Right? And so, I’m going to try and identify the papers that I used for each print. And I probably came up with a very tonal silver paper for that, because it’s printed very tonal. I mean, it’s not a graphic print, the Buffaloes, at all, the 30x40. And then his wasn’t, really, either. So maybe I did see the Portriga. I’m not sure. I can’t remember. But the same thing happened – is Nan Goldin’s archive here too? No.\nMT:\tNo.\nGS:\tOkay. Because the same thing happened with her where she really didn’t want me to see her prints when I printed for her. Yeah, it was interesting. But with her I insisted. And then we borrowed – this was all the early, early black-and-white stuff. So we borrowed stuff from David. He actually had some of them, like, the small prints she made as a student. Yeah.\nMT:\tWe also have from him a large print of Nan with the black eye.\nGS:\tReally? I love that image.\nMT:\tYeah, I do, too. But I have always assumed that she gave it to him.\nGS:\tShe must have. Maybe they did an exchange. They could have. Yeah, they were really close, How many photographs of him are there by her? Or we don’t know.\nMT:\tI don’t know.\nGS:\tI don’t know either.\nDK:\tSeveral, though.\nGS:\tI wonder if there are some in the – I should go look at the latest version of  -- but apparently this version of – I’m sorry; I don’t mean to keep changing the subject. Of the Ballad.\t\t[48:00]\nMT:\tRight. Because he wasn’t in it, originally.\nGS:\tNo, no; it was too early, the original one. And it had some of the black-and-white work in it, the original one. And now it doesn’t have any. I saw it at the Whitney when they showed it as part of the first installation. But I’d be curious to see how much David or Peter there is in the Peter Hujar there. So okay, back to  -- so he didn’t, he didn’t. And it was unusual for him, with me and him, because I remember clearly, with other artists, very specific conversations about papers, about toning, about proofing. There was none; I don’t remember any with David.\nDK:\tThat is really interesting.\nGS:\tI know, I know.\nDK:\tOr framing? I know that with the Sex Series he had those colored frames.\nGS:\tNo. That was his; that was his.\nDK:\tAdded by, I forget the name; Stephan Petrik.\nGS:\tNone of the prints I owned were framed in that way.\nDK:\tThat was perhaps for an exhibition.\nGS:\tNo, no, no; he chose that frame. PPOW are calling it artist’s frame.\nDK:\tYeah. That’s what Wendy said.\nGS:\tSo obviously there was this relationship, but others __[49:23]\nDK:\tThere was a color relationship maybe, because I think they were different colors.\nGS:\tI don’t know that part. [all laugh] Sorry.\nDK:\tDid he by any chance talk about the types of cameras that he used?\nGS:\tNo, but he must have had a camera before – did he inherit any of Peter’s cameras?\nDK:\tI think initially Peter gave him a camera early on in their relationship.\nGS:\tOh. Yes.\nDK:\tAnd the first camera he used somebody also had given to him, so it seems there’s a sort of a serendipity as to what cameras he was using, rather than an active\n[6]\nGS:\tWell he was very poor. Well, Peter was probably poorer, actually, I imagine. Anyway, they wouldn’t have been competing like who was going to be the poorest. [all laugh] But they were very poor. And it’s interesting to me Peter could give him a camera, actually. Because actually Peter owned a Leica, a really amazing one that he then had to sell because he needed money. And he immediately regretted it and then tried to find another one of the same quality. It was extraordinary, the first one. And so I can’t imagine Peter being able to afford to give him a camera.\nDK:\tI should, especially since this is on record, say maybe that should be fact checked as well.\nMT:\tYes, because Cindy talks\nGS:\tBut you’re not writing a book. Are you writing a book?\nDK:\tNo.\nGS:\tOh, okay, this is just really an oral history.\nMT:\tRight. Cindy talks about him giving her a camera just before he died. So there must have been more than one camera floating around. But she may remember. So I would verify with Cindy.\nGS:\tHave you interviewed her yet?\nDK:\t__ [51:20] he borrowed a camera from other people at times to shoot something.\nGS:\tBut there was a lot of film early on before he made – no, I have no idea. There was enough film processing that, at the time of the Civilian Warfare show, he came in and said, well, you know, you do for, like, to choose something. Because I remember going into that show to choose something, and it was already sold. And so then he walked in with this huge map. [laughing] I don’t know. In its box, it was probably the size of __.[52:00] It was really a big school map, you know, those like roll-up school maps. I mean, it was kind of an amazing thing. And I talk about it in Cindy’s book. It’s kind of a nice little anecdote. And I wish I still had it. But, you know; we didn’t have the storage at the time.\nMT:\tWell he had been photographing early on because the early journals are filled with photographs.\nGS:\tYeah.\nMT:\tSo he had to have some manner of camera.\nGS:\tSo where did he print those? So he always photographed, I think.\nMT:\tOne of the things that’s fascinating in the journals is, he goes back again and again to photo booths and has his picture taken, and then pastes them into the journals.\nGS:\tOh my god.\nMT:\tAnd there’s one of him when he was a young boy, as well, so clearly this is something that he picked up from his mother, probably.\nGS:\tDid he keep doing that ‘til the end?\nMT:\tNot really to the end. The journals trail off at some point because I think he was just too sick to write. Although we did just find\nGS:\tSo, I mean, they keep going until he got diagnosed, then.\nMT:\tRight. And after that, I think they trail off in ’91.\nGS:\tOh, so they go very late.\nMT:\tBut we did find what we believe to be the last note that he left, and it’s from the day before he died.\nGS:\tWow. Yeah, he was really an amazing patient, truly the most amazing. Because he kind of, I don’t know, he was sort of a great teacher, in a way. I think he thought of his life as a kind of, I don’t know. [all laugh] He was very generous as a sick person. Really generous. Interestingly.\nDK:\tYou mean with his time, emotions, availability?\nGS:\tWith his time, and yes, with his emotions, and accessibility. I mean, I think he was very careful who he was accessible to, but he was very generous to his friends. Emotionally.\nDK:\tAnd he was working up until the end?\nGS:\tWell, as you say, I think it trailed off. At a certain point he probably assumed he couldn’t make the right decisions. I think that’s really what happened. But he worked as late as possible. You know wat I mean, he kept working. So, for example, Aperture wanted to use Face in the Dirt for, I think it was some anniversary issue of the magazine that he was in. Or was it the magazine that was him?\nDK:\tThe Aperture, the Brush Fires.\nGS:\tDidn’t that happen posthumously, the publication?\nDK:\tThey were working on it.\nMT:\tAnd he died.\nDK:\tI think it came out, like a couple of months after he died.\nGS:\tNo, no, no; I think Face in the Dirt predates the Brush Fires book. And magazine. They did the magazine first.\n[7]\nDK:\tBut the special issue of the magazine that then became Brush Fires\nGS:\tYes, but that was all David.\nDK:\tThat was all David; exactly.\nGS:\tBut there was something else where they used the Face in the Dirt. He was in the hospital. And I remember sitting in the waiting room with Ira, actually, and we were sort of getting to know each other. We were just hanging out. And I was bringing him the print for reproduction, to sign off on. And it’s lost now, apparently; right? It’s not anywhere. It was small. It was like an 11x14 probably. Now it’s not around. So yeah, he did actually – because the edition is posthumous, the 20x24 edition. That’s posthumous.\nDK:\tYeah, I was going to ask, and you printed that posthumous edition.\nGS:\tYes.\nDK:\tOkay. That’s the one that’s in MoMA’s collection. It’s like ’93 or ’94, something like that.\n[8]\nGS:\tIs that when it was printed?\nDK:\tYeah.\nGS:\tIt’s an amazing image.\nDK:\tYeah.\nMT:\tIt really is.\nGS:\tI would love to hear, I would love to read, the story around it, like Marion’s story. Are these going to be available?\nMT:\tMm-hm.\nGS:\tAre they? Oh. Oh.\nDK:\tOh yeah, we should do a release, actually.\nMT:\tYes, absolutely. I’m glad you reminded me. [all laugh] We’ll do that after.\nGS:\tYeah, yeah. You can even sign it for me; I don’t care. [all laugh]\nDK:\tDid you have also, just to make sure that we’re __[56:43]\nGS:\tNo, no, I love talking. [laughing] I can talk forever. I just have a dinner date. [all laugh]\nDK:\tOkay.\nGS:\tWhat else?\nDK:\tThat’s interesting. And I didn’t know that it was printed in Aperture before it was printed in that special issue.\nGS:\tIt was. Actually, I should find out what that was. It was some anniversary issue of Aperture. Yeah, they would know.\n[9]\nDK:\tAnd that was before you made the test print for reproduction.\nGS:\tWell, it was made for it.\nDK:\tOh, okay.\nGS:\tThat print was made because of the Aperture, they needed a print for reproduction, and David chose that, actually. So that was, you know; that’s interesting. So he had selected that specifically before his death. I would love to see the small print, but if you don’t have it.\nMT:\tWe might have it.\nGS:\tBut you would know. Believe me, you would know.\nMT:\tThere’s a lot of stuff that I’ve never looked at.\nGS:\tYou mean, there’s so much material.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tReally?\nMT:\tAlthough that one I would remember if I had seen it.\nDK:\tI tried looking for it, too.\nMT:\tYou did? It’s not there.\nDK:\tWell, I wasn’t able to look through everything, either.\nGS:\tSo maybe the negatives might be able to be found. I wish that were possible. Are you looking through stuff?\nDK:\tAs much as I can. The problem is, Fales is closed next week.\nMT:\tThat doesn’t mean anything for you.\nDK:\tThat’s good to knowe.\nMT:\tYou can come down.\nGS:\tI would love to know.\nDK:\tYeah, if I get down to that material.\nGS:\tThen Harvard would just approach you and you would negotiate the possibility of borrowing it. Okay. Because it’s probably the most – I mean, even though I did copy work for so many different people, and some really important things, for me that’s the most important. And maybe the most complex, actually, because of the – in a way, the scale is critical to, literally, how do you read this thing. You know. It’s an interesting thing. So there had to be the shift in scale.\nDK:\tHow is your body positioned while you’re reading it, as well. __[58:57]\nGS:\tBut also though, literally, just legibility. Like, the size of the text, the size of the, like, the contrast between the text and the ground. That stuff had to be amended to the size of the print. It was an interesting process. It wasn’t easy. And he was definitely involved in that. Right? Because it had to function in a particular way. Because the print already existed, the 20x24.\nDK:\tSo it wasn’t about adjusting the size of the text, for instance.\nGS:\tNo, no, because the print already existed. Yes. I re-photographed the big print, and then I started to like manipulate the new print to function, literally, to be readable.\nDK:\tAnd so the manipulations were density, contrast,\nGS:\tYes.\nDK:\tThe exact size, or if you were printing it a certain size, you were printing it that size.\nGS:\tYes. It was just that size.\nDK:\tRight. Okay. So, density, contrast.\nGS:\tIt’s interesting; right? So it would be wonderful to put those, as I said earlier, to put the 16x20 next to a 20x20, or, to see how different it is. At this point, it would be really interesting to see, actually.\nDK:\tWell, we can definitely, if they’re 8x10 negatives, that narrows it down. So.\nGS:\tThey’re the only copy of things that I made so they’re the only big negatives that would exist. And I don’t know where else they could be, other than at Aperture or in California with Nash Editions, because they’re made.\nDK:\tWhy were they printed out there?\nGS:\tThey were doing, you know, they had one of the only Iris printers, and it’s now at the Smithsonian, their printer, actually. [all laugh]\nDK:\tInteresting. I didn’t know that.\nGS:\tYeah, yeah; well, I know all of those kind of ephemera. [all laugh]\nDK:\tThinking about the sort of milieu and shops he may have frequented, do you know where he may have printed his photostats or gotten things typeset?\nGS:\tI have no idea. Because it would just leave me. And then all of a sudden a print would come back with a text on it, you know, screen printed. And luckily it was done very well, because it hasn’t really shifted over time. You would imagine ink on silver emulsion might have had funny --. So obviously, he was doing things very carefully. He was like really researching conservation, sort of, storage problems and so on. Even though he did print on posters, and those seem to have survived. Right? So he did really well with, like, archival issues, like how to archive something. Right? What is the story? It’s not such a big thing. Now.\nMT:\tThe store posters will eventually all deteriorate. They’re very fragile. He loved yellow notebooks, yellow note pads, and he used magic markers. So there’s nothing we can do to preserve them.\nGS:\tThere’s really nothing? What’s happening to them? What happens to magic marker?\nMT:\tIt’s very acidic, and the yellow paper is really acidic, on the legal pads. And so they’ll slowly – the magic marker will fade, and then eventually fall out. So there will just be holes in the text.\nGS:\tLiterally. Oh. Can’t they be put into, like, vacuums? I mean like literally.\nMT:\tRight now, the acidification process is aqueous, and so you can’t put these into water or else they’ll fade. So it’s really impossible at this point to preserve them.\nGS:\tWow. So the only way really to preserve them is to re-photograph them actually. Have you done that?\nMT:\tWe’ve digitized the journals.\nGS:\tWell then in a way, they’re conserved.\nMT:\tRight. Because they’re the most requested thing that we have.\nGS:\tAnd so they’re on line?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tOh, that’s amazing. The entire? Anything you’ve digitized? Oh, it’s all controlled.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tYou have to ask permission.\nMT:\tWell, Tom’s been really good about that.\nGS:\tTom’s amazing about stuff like that, it seems.\nMT:\tWe’ve digitized all of the film fragments and all of that material.\nGS:\tWow; that’s incredible.\nMT:\tAnd all of the audio that we had, the interviews that David gave that he had kept copies of.\nGS:\tOoh. What about his readings?\nMT:\tWe have some of them. Yes.\nGS:\tReally? Oh, wow. You don’t have the reading of that text without – it had some music track put onto it at some point.\nMT:\tI don’t think so; I’d have to ask our media specialist.\nGS:\tOh, okay. Because I was at that reading; it was at, I think, the Drawing Center. That was pretty amazing.\nDK:\tThere was music playing over?\nGS:\tThat was after the fact. There was no music playing at the time.\nMT:\tThat’s when he read the thing about Jesse Helms, as well. It’s so powerful.\nGS:\tYeah. I can remember his face doing it. Did you know David?\nMT:\tI didn’t know David.\nGS:\tOh, okay; you’re too young or something.\nMT:\tNo, I was here, but I came in ’88, so it was, you know. And I loved his work, I sort of saw it around, but I was working at Columbia, and so. [RS laughs] Even though I was coming down here all the time, I was a little, I wasn’t upon the scene.\nGS:\tYeah, that reading was very memorable.\nMT:\tThere are other readings that stand out?\nGS:\tThe other performances, but not like that one. That was like, oh my god, that was devastating, that performance. Was the whole thing recorded?\nMT:\tIt was. They record everything. Yeah, it’s film.\nGS:\tOh, they record it?\nMT:\tThe Drawing Center.\nGS:\tOh, So you have a copy of that.\nMT:\tI don’t know that we have a copy, but it’s out there on the Web. It’s widely available.\nGS:\tThrough the Drawing Center.\nMT:\tI think so.\nGS:\tOkay, I’m going to look for it. Because I would love to remember, see what my memory\nMT:\tIt’s really over the top powerful.\nGS:\tThat’s was the most memorable. But he did something, he did several readings. Because Peter was so obsessed with him, we would just go to all of his – I would go with Peter. [laughing] To all of his events. But by the Drawing Center time, David and I were very close already.\nDK:\tSo the performances, there’s Three Teens Kill 4 performances, The Kitchen performance, there’s readings.\nGS:\tWhat’s the date on the Kitchen performance?\nDK:\tIs that also ’89? ITSOFOMO at The Kitchen?  Around ’89, with Ben Neill.\n[10]\nGS:\tAnd Drawing Center is?\nDK:\tDrawing Center I don’t know off the top of my head.\n[11]\nGS:\tMaybe even – like, late; it’s late.\nMT:\tIt’s late; its’ very late. Because he’s clearly ill.\nGS:\tHe’s already – yes; yes. It’s an effort; right? You feel the effort.\nMT:\tYes, you can; yeah.\nGS:\tSo maybe it’s really late. When in ’92 did he die?\nMT:\tHe died July 14th of ’92? It might be July 16th?\n[12]\nThere’s an incredible photo of Tom and him on his deathbed, that’s just.\nGS:\tOh wow. I mean, it could have been as late as ’92, like somewhere in ’92, sort of February, or. It could have been. It is very late. You feel that this is that effort. Oh, I can’t wait to. Oh, maybe not [laughing]\nMT:\tYeah. It’s tough. It’s really tough.\nGS:\tI have to really be – I’ll prepare myself. [laughing]\nMT:\tI’ve watched it.\nGS:\tI can’t imagine. Because even that one piece of reading – I’ve only seen it with the sound [music?] under it, and the sound really kind of interrupts it, I think. So it’s not – yeah, it’s tough.\nDK:\tI was just thinking about that, because we’re gathering these first-person accounts of the performances or site-specific installations that may have stood out to you. Are there installations you saw with Peter or?\nGS:\tI remember going to – I would go with, like, when Peter photographed at the piers, I was with him. Right? So I was always like the eyes in the back of Peter’s head, like when he was doing self-portraits on the pier or photographing them. We would go on tours of when there was all that mural work done at the piers.\nDK:\tYeah, the Ward Line Project.\nGS:\tYeah, I remember that very well. Do you have a lot of those images?\nDK:\tOf the piers? Yes, there’s pretty good documentation of the piers. Marion Scemama took photos, Andreas Sterzing.\nGS:\tYou have those.\nMT:\tWe have some. Andreas\nGS:\tDid David take photos?\nMT:\tHe did.\nGS:\tHe did. He didn’t print them, though. Did he print them?\nMT:\tWe have some; we have some images.\nGS:\tOh, there are some prints. But small – did he print them like 8x10?\nMT:\tSome 8x10s, some 5x7s. I just saw – where did I see that?  I just saw a bunch of photos by somebody, photos of the piers that I had never seen. Now I’ve lost where it was. Too many things going on.\nGS:\tOh yeah, yeah, yeah. Reproduced somewhere; right?\nMT:\tRight. Very recently.\nGS:\tLike, really good. Maybe even out of Leslie-Lohman.\nMT:\tYeah, I think that’s where it was.\t\t\t\t\t[1:09:09]\nGS:\tI think so. I think it was like kind of amazing, actually, this one of Peter, like, having sex by someone else. Right? And then I think you see some like wall paintings around the event. Well, the piers was quite fabulous, really bizarre. [all laugh] I mean, for your generation, there’s no way to conceptualize what Manhattan was like at that – you know. Because now it’s so cleaned up.\nDK:\tSo I think that’s such an interest in that now, of people in my generation.\nGS:\tYes, because it’s not possible to really understand.\nDK:\tLike the last Greater New York had all the Alvin Baltrop images. And there’s a fascination, I think, specifically with that kind of space, that post-industrial sort of cathedral-like spaces.\nGS:\tIt’s sort of post-apocalyptic. I mean, there were really, like the East Village and sort of Alphabet City, was very burnt out. I mean it was dangerous, it was really dangerous.\nMT:\tIt was really dangerous.\nGS:\tAnd exciting, because nobody had any money and there was all of this activity, and none of it had to do with money. And now it’s like, you know, Manhattan is so much kind of an entertainment center, in a totally different way. It’s weird; right?\nMT:\tAnd sexuality was different.\nGS:\tIt was pre-HIV. Yeah, it was a different moment. Hah. [he laughs]\nMT:\tAnd it was all analog.\nGS:\tAnd it was all analog. Actually, that’s the title of the show at Harvard, it’s called Analog Culture. It makes sense.\nMT:\tSure.\nGS:\tThat’s so interesting. Yeah, that’s what they thought, too. Even though like the Peter Hujars are printed in ink, they’re printed digitally. And there’s some Gober printed digitally. But it was a different way of thinking, too; right? Because of that.\nDK:\tI think that’s why I’m sort of interested in surfacing some of these technical processes that were intuitive, or just, oh yeah -- you just could get a cel printed at Kinkos – that aren’t necessarily accessible now, because people aren’t using those processes any more.\nGS:\tWell I imagine that’s sort of what he did do, because even, I mean, I still remember going from print store to print store to print out my articles. Because if you had a show, there wasn’t a file of digital, of like the reviews and the CV. You actually made a book, you made a folder. You made a folder! I wonder if I’ve kept one of those. And it was a lot of energy, because, you know,  this one store reproduced color well, and that one did black-and-white better. It was really a problem. And oh god, how much time we had to spend. [they laugh] \nDK”\tA lot of face-to-face and networking.\nGS:\tAnd then you made slides for reproduction of the work. Like, PPOW would order a set of slides of the show so they could send it out for press and so on. Do you have all that stuff of his? Do you have all of his slides?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tHis show slides. So he didn’t throw that out. Well I suppose, in a way, because he was, 1992, it kind of predates digital, big time. Digital only really came in full time, full on, like around 2005, I would imagine, 2006, maybe even later. Right? Not so long ago.\nDK:\tYeah. I was still working with slides when I first started working in a museum in 2006. People would send slides.\nGS:\tReally? What did they do with their slide archives? Did they digitize them? Which museum?\nDK:\tAt the Whitney.\nGS:\tOh. What have they done with it?\nDK:\tThey still have them.\nGS:\tThey do! I can’t throw them out. It’s really a problem. Thousands.\nDK:\tI think MoMA still does, too, but they’re not served any more, so you would have to go out to the warehouse.\nGS:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. That’s so bizarre.\nMT:\tWe have tens of thousands of slides. It’s a real issue for preservation, because they’re all deteriorating. Rapidly.\nGS:\tWell, it depends who made them. If they’re Kodak they are; right? Yeah. Oy. If they’re Kodachrome – which is the ones that are very stable? I think it’s Kodachrome.\nMT:\tIs that the ones?\nGS:\tI’m sorry; I’m forgetting.\nDK:\tIt should be stable, but then there were, like, bad years. That’s what I’ve heard; “Oh, that was from that bad year.”\nGS:\tWhen I did the Paul Thek that Peter photographed, he’d photographed him making the tomb. They were sort of close at that point. And those were shown at the Whitney. Those slides are really faded. They’re very pink. And so it’s interesting; right? But of course, it’s very easy digitally to, kind of, in a way, excavate them. So they need to be digitized, but there are thousands. It was a culture. I mean, that really was how we communicated, was through slides. You made slide sheets. [laughing] Time consuming, and expensive. It’s a very expensive, like, James Dee was the person who was the most – do you know who that is?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tI wonder what happened to his archive. Because he photographed every show. He was the go-to photographer. And he had a studio on Wooster Street, a big loft, and he just sold it.\nMT:\tOh, I remember this. Right.\nGS:\tHe just sold the loft and moved to Florida.\nMT:\tRight. There was a Times article, about what to do with it.\n[13]\nBecause he had so many hundreds of thousands of slides, that nobody could really take it on. I thought about it, but it would have overwhelmed us.\n[14]\n[15]\nGS:\tIt’s just too big; right?\nMT:\tYes. And I don’t\nGS:\tAnd they were not small. They were like 4x5 and 8x10.\nMT:\tRight.\nGS:\tI used to, I ordered 8x10. I mean, I used to make 8x10, but I ordered 4x5 from him.\nMT:\tAnd I don’t remember what happened to it.\nGS:\tWow.\nMT:\tI want to say Yale.\nDK:\tDid it go to the Getty? I think I remember that article.\nMT:\tIt might be the Getty. Yes. Yale got Larry – this guy went around from like 1968 on, photographing every show, uptown, downtown. And so Yale got that collection. I can’t remember his last name.\nGS:\tWow. And it’s all slides as well?\nMT:\tIt was both slides and prints.\nGS:\tBut not black-and-white?\nMT:\tA lot of black-and-white.\nGS:\tOh. Yes, those archives are going to become very useful. Right? Documents. They’re amazing.\nDK:\tSo thinking back to the sort of analog moment – we’ll go another 15 minutes and end at 3:30.  What sort of services did your shop offer? We’ve talked about making copy negatives and making enlargements for Wojnarowicz. Were there other services that you did for him?\nGS:\tFor David?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1:16:50]\nDK:\tYes.\nGS:\tWell, we processed his film, made contact sheets for him, and I don’t know what else. No, that’s it, for him. But we did a lot of other things. Like, we did corporate annual reports, I mean, we weren’t making money from artists, particularly. [all laugh] I did all of that printing because I wanted to. But we did commercial work, as well. So a lot of artists, like the Magnum photographers, would also be doing, like, they needed to make money, too. So they would be doing corporate annual reports, and we would do that. It was huge quantities of film, and then these prints for reproduction. It’s interesting for your generation. We’d have to make a print for reproduction, so that the print would then be re-photographed for the reproduction. I know, pre-digital is almost difficult, it’s almost impossible to conceptualize; right? I know.\nDK:\tAnd so then when he was working on the Tongues of Flame catalogue, were you making prints for that book?\nGS:\tNo. Um, but the Tongues of Flame catalogue; what date is that?\nDK:\tThat’s ’89 or ’90. I guess ’90 is when it came out. He was working on it in ’89.\nGS:\tYeah, he wouldn’t have been really involved with that. Would he?\nMT:\tHe was. Yeah, I went out actually to see Barry Blinderman, because he’s got the documents about that show.\nGS:\tWhat would David have provided for the catalogue?\nMT:\tAlmost everything. A lot of text, slides. There’s a whole binder of slides that David sent to Barry to look at.\nGS:\tFor reproduction.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tYes, it could have been reproduced from slides.\nMT:\tRight.\nGS:\tYou could do that as well. You didn’t have to make prints.\nMT:\tAnd they did it out there. The university at Illinois State did it.\nGS:\tI wonder if he had slides of the black-and-white as well. Do you think that was re-photographed as slides?\nMT:\tI don’t remember. I looked at them quickly and just realized that I want the stuff because it’s really detailed about the show.\nGS:\tOh yeah, yeah; that was such an important show. You see, PPOW would have had slides made for reproduction for him.\nDK:\tI think because it was a retrospective, he was also going back to other galleries and gathering the slides that they had.\nGS:\tLike Gracie, and, yeah, yeah.\nDK:\tExactly. So that’s why, how, he was involved, because he was invested in this as a retrospective.\nGS:\tIt was like his first big show.\nDK:\tIt was.\nGS:\tThough in Normal. And he loved being there. He spent a lot of time there; didn’t he.\nMT:\tHe did.\nGS:\tLike, really a lot of time. He was like in residence there, wasn’t he?\nMT:\tHe was.\nGS:\tYeah, yeah, yeah; for how long?\nMT:\tThat I don’t know but yes, he stayed with Barry. So he and Barry’s son, who was like six or eight at the time, drew cartoons for each other. And Barry’s got these hilarious little cartoons that David was drawing for him. It’s a wonderful story.\nGS:\tSo sweet. [laughs] So yeah, so we were like a, we were a small lab. We were maybe, it was John, me, there was another front person, and then a few people in the back, someone processing film, and at one point, two other printers, and then one other printer; well, two other printers. So that’s quite a few people, really. So we were not big, but we were a functioning business. Not surviving well, [laughs] but we did it for a few years.\nDK:\tSo it was for a limited period of time?\nGS:\tWell I would say the lab ran from – well, I’m still printing. But the lab as a functioning lab was 1980 through, I’m not exactly sure of the end date of it because it sort of petered out, but through, like, the end of the century.\nDK:\tOkay. What was the address?\t\t\t\t\t\t[1:21:18]\nGS:\tIt was 32 Cooper Square. [laughs] On the third floor. It’s now very fancy. It wasn’t so fancy before. [all laugh] But it was a great loft. It was this huge, beautiful loft. And then I lived on St. Mark’s Place. Then we lost that and moved into like the ground floor basement on 54 St. Mark’s Place. And it was very large, like 2,000 [square?] feet. So I had a darkroom in the basement and then I bought a big darkroom on line to do very large prints. So I continued it.\nDK:\tSo the large prints were made\nGS:\tThey were made at 32 Cooper. I had a wonderful darkroom at 32 Cooper, really a great darkroom. Huge sink.\nDK:\tAnd had you seen the darkroom in Peter Hujar’s loft?\nGS:\tWell, what’s sort of sad about Peter’s darkroom – yeah, yeah; absolutely – it got built for him. And I’m trying to remember the guy’s name now. Once Peter was sick, the new darkroom got built. But before that, he had this really grungy little darkroom that was sort of – I’m trying to visualize where it could have – because it’s changed around. It was behind a black curtain. It was a really small darkroom. And he would squeegee his prints on his blue kitchen table – he would wash his table and he would squeegee his prints right there. So David inherited a pretty much unused new darkroom that got built for Peter. It had a real door, a real sink, and you know, it had all that stuff. It wasn’t sort of put-together. Interesting.\nMT:\tTotally interesting.\nDK:\tAnd he could print up to 20x24.\nGS:\tNo, he could print up to 16x20. Because that’s what Peter did. And the 20x24s he would have had to have, like, printed in a 16x20 tray. So he would have printed them like sort of going in and out of the chemistry. And so actually, those 20x24s of the Sex Series, the surfaces are not perfect, if I remember correctly. Because they’re so manipulated. It’s curious; right? I know; I’d love to see them.\nDK:\tYeah. We’ve talked about the Sex Series in depth, I think, and a bit about When I Put my Hands on Your Body. Are there other projects with him or collaborations with him that stand out, that either required a lot of back and forth, or required particular technical challenges?\nGS:\tNo, there were never technical challenges with his work. Actually, he was a really good photographer and he really knew how to make a negative. Which is interesting in retrospect; right? He must have been trained. Actually, that did come out. Didn’t that come out in Cindy’s book? That he had studied photography in high school. Right? He had gone to like an art school. Yeah. So he did have photography. He knew what to do.\n[16]\n[17]\nDK:\tIt had been a long time prior, though.\nGS:\tAnd then, maybe Peter taught him, also. I imagine Peter coached him.\nMT:\tWe have a note that says “Peter’s Instructions for Printing,” and it’s in David’s hand.\nGS:\tReally? Ah, so he had a recipe.\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tThat’s amazing.\nDK:\tThat is amazing. When are all of these things going to be published so I can see them? [he laughs] See, I love stuff like that.\nMT:\tYeah, I love those, too. Because it’s proof that Peter taught him how to print.\nGS:\tAnd I love that he kept it, that it sort of sits there as a recipe. I see you’ve made a note for yourself to look it up.\nDK:\tYes, I’d love to find it. If we can scan it for the Web resource.\nMT:\tYes, we should. It’s in magic marker on yellow paper.\nGS:\tOh, it is? Well it has to be scanned, quick.\nMT:\tAnd it’s a single sheet, so it’s not in a notebook or anything.\nGS:\tSo magic marker\nMT:\tThat was his favorite.\nGS:\tIs the devil.\nMT:\tYeah. It’s evil.\nGS:\tReally; because it’s acid.\nMT:\tIt’s really acidic; yeah.\nGS:\tWow. And the yellow paper specifically is acidic. Really? It’s so popular.\nMT:\tYes, it’s the dye. It’s the coloring in it.\nGS:\tWow. Does regular notepad\nMT:\tIt deteriorates, but\nGS:\tNot as fast.\nMT:\tNot as fast. Right.\nGS:\tWow, that’s sad; huh?\nDK:\tWhat’s the best paper to write on if you’re keeping a journal?\nMT:\tYou should get something that’s acid-free. Or something that’s hand made.\nGS:\tAnd use a Pigma pen. [laughing] So Julie Ault just went through the collection and found that box?\nMT:\tWell, I’ve shown that box to a lot of people.\nGS:\tOh, it’s like your pride and joy. It’s a fabulous collection of things.\nMT:\tIt’s what made me rethink how we archive, how we keep collections. Because most places wouldn’t have kept the Magic Box. Right? It’s not a work. It’s an object.\nGS:\tIt’s ephemera.\nMT:\tAnd archives don’t really like to keep that kind of stuff.\nGS:\tThey just want the art; right?\nMT:\tOr they want the documentation. And it’s this funny thing; we actually describe it as its own object. We didn’t put it, really, under “Objects;” we put it under “the Magic Box.”\nGS:\tI think it was kind of magical for him, to put certain things together.\nMT:\tYeah, and he wrote “Magic Box” on top of it.\nGS:\t[laughing] Oh, he did; it is written on; I forgot that. Because you showed the box itself.\nMT:\tRight. And it’s physical representations of his metaphors.\nGS:\tOh, that’s very interesting.\nMT:\tYes, one after another. And it’s essential, I think, to understanding the work. But he never shared it with anybody. Cindy wasn’t able to find anybody who knew anything about it.\n[18]\nTom has told me that David kept it under the bed, and that he would take it out and play with it once in a while, but he never talked to Tom about it. It was very personal. I’ve said this, several times. I think it goes to his sense of spirituality. It goes pretty directly there. And he was very Catholic, in a whole lot of ways, and nobody talks about it. They think that he was really rabidly anti-Catholic because he was against the – but the work is really, really filled with spiritualism, I think. And a very Catholic sense of the spiritual.\nDK:\tYeah, sort of icons.\nMT:\tExactly.\nGS:\tBut making his own icons.\nMT:\tExactly; right.\nGS:\tSo maybe the child’s skeleton was so – I mean, the metaphor is so intense.\nMT:\tI know. It’s very David.\nGS:\t[laughing] It’s like, oh my god.\nMT:\tBarry Blinderman says that if you had to pick one object that depicts David Wojnarowicz, it’s the burning house.\nGS:\tYeah. Well, it’s one of the first images.\nMT:\tIt is, and it’s so\nGS:\tIs it the first?\nMT:\tIt’s one of the very early images.\nGS:\tThat’s one he did on the street.\nMT:\tYes, and it’s there again and again and again.\nGS:\tWell, he kept all of his images again and again and again. So they start out having incredible import, and then they remain. But it was such a short life. Like, now that I’m this age, I realize, you know, you die in your thirties, like, what does that mean? It’s such a short, like, how many years of real production were there? Like ten? Right? Maybe a little more?\nMT:\tAnd he couldn’t seem to stop creating. The collection, he kept a phone log. And the phone logs, he’s sitting there drawing and doing all kinds of other things while he’s talking on the phone with people.\nGS:\tAre these also on yellow paper?\nMT:\tNo, they tend to be on spiral-bound; don’t they? Or a little bit of everything.\nDK:\tOn everything, yeah. There are some yellow pads in there. There are lots of spiral-bound notebooks, and some scraps.\nGS:\tSo do you have full-time people like documenting to digitize these things?\nMT:\tWe haven’t digitized very much.\nGS:\tYou need to get __[1:29:45]\nMT:\tThat’s a topic we can’t actually\nGS:\tI’m curious about Fales because in a way, it’s grown so fast. Is it just pouring in because you’re now so famous for this particular kind of archive; right?\nMT:\tMaybe we should\nGS:\tOh, we have to stop?\nMT:\tYes.\nGS:\tOkay.\nMT:\tBecause then I can answer your question.\nDK:\tThis is a good time, anyway.

This is Diana Kamin and Marvin Taylor interviewing David Kiehl at Fales Library. So, David, you had talked about the first stencil you remember seeing being the Burning House. One of my first questions was going to be, how did you first learn about Wojnarowicz’s work?\nDK:\tI just knew him. I was living in Tribeca in ’79 to ’81, and I wasn’t sure who it was. I just knew there was this person who was doing burning houses and falling men and other things on the sidewalk. And that’s, I never put two and two together until the auction in 2001.\nDi:\tOh, really?\nDK:\tBut it was definitely – I didn’t really know his name, but he was the person doing the sidewalks just like Jenny Holzer’s posters were on the side of buildings, his were on the sidewalk. And they were just these burning houses, falling men type thing.\nDi:\tAnd you’ve been the Curator of Prints at the Whitney Museum since 1993. I was wondering if you could speak to – before we get into the retrospective. Obviously, you’re also the curator of the retrospective, but before we get into that, if you could speak to his print practice, specifically, what kind of different printing techniques did he work with, what printers did he work with, and how is his approach to prints different than other artists at that time?\nDK:\tI think a lot of it is just commercial work, commercial printing, because the first formal edition, I think, was the one done with Kiki Smith. And I am not sure, David sort of knew how to get money for doing it. Kiki knew how to do screen printing. And I’m almost sure that they got the money, I think, from Public Art Fund? I think; I’m not sure. But they probably made that series of __[2:18] which Fales has the screens for the ropes and the Rorschach tests on top. And they had previously photostatted or had gone to the copy shop and had the sheets taken out at the Wardline Pier, the drawings by the psych patients, and laid those out for the papers. So that they had the money to do nice paper. I think they must have done it pretty much home-made jobs. I think that’s most of what David’s work was, home-made. I think you only get him doing formal presses when he went out to Illinois with the set of two diptychs on the Four Elements and the little brain etching. The brain etching, I think, was just sort of a few were run off and that was it. And the Act Up is the other formal work. Everything else is pretty much home-made, going to the copy shops. One Day This Boy was done at, was it Giant Photo? Or __[3:45] photocopy in Union Square? I think that’s probably where it was done. They were pretty much done home-mades.\nDi:\tSo that said, you’ve managed to bring in work to the Whitney’s collection, through the Prints Committee, that weren’t necessarily formal editions. Is that correct?\nDK:\tYes. I mean, the whole thing starts in 2001. In August, I opened up a – I had on my wish list, I had always had One Day This Kid, because I felt that was the one – we had Sex Series, we had Bandaged Hands. I thought the one thing we really needed was One Day This Kid, if you’re talking about the ‘80s. And so I was always sort of on the lookout for that, but had no way to find out how I could get one. So I was watching auction catalogues. And I opened up a junky catalogue from Christie’s, sort of the end of the bin sales. And I’m going through it, and I say, ‘Wait; that’s the guy who painted on the sidewalks.’ Or stenciled on the sidewalks. And it’s in the show. It’s the map of the United States with the falling man and the radiation. And it’s probably one of the best impressions of that set, doing that composition, that I know of. So I had to figure out how to get it, because I was not going to be in town for that auction, because I was supposed to be in Estonia. And I had to figure out, how do we get someone to buy it so that I could then get – they could act as our agent so they could bring it to the Print Committee. Because stencils are a print-making process. I guess technically you would say they’re drawing, but I think of them as a print-making process. That’s the basis of screen printing and everything else. And I finally found out that the estate was at PPOW. So they agreed to act as our agent. The auction was 13th of September, 2001. It didn’t happen. I didn’t even get to Estonia. I was supposed to leave on the 11th of September. But it was the next month, we secured it at a very low price, and that acquisition started – Steve and Walter Sudol gave us our first painting at that time, one of the first of the Red Monkeys. In fact, there is a photograph that David took that Marion had a small version of, of a woman holding the Red Monkey, from that image. That started, I said, ‘Okay, we have the one. What else is there? If you have the estate, what else is there?’ So I started combing through the literature. I had them go through the estate two or three times, go through everything. What they called going through, it’s not as thorough as I would have gone through. But they turned up a large body of work, and anything – I was throwing in stencils, anything that I could vaguely put into this body of work. Then I had to figure, okay, the Print Committee needs to step in; how do I do it? I talked to the chair of my committee. She agreed we should really go ahead. And I knew that I wanted to make it a two – because it was a lot of money for the Print Committee. And I asked them to – I wanted them to vote once and then vote again at a second meeting, so that they had time to think. And in between, we set up an event at PPOW one evening. We got Kiki Smith to come in. ‘Oh, I don’t know if I can talk about -- I don’t have much to say” for an hour and a half monologue [laughter] on David. By the end of it, even the men in the group were in tears. So I knew we were on our way. And we acquired at that time about thirty things. I don’t think we could ever do that again, because all of a sudden, people got interested in – I think growing out of the whole thing of the literature movement, David as a writer, then they started to look for the things by David. So I don’t think we could ever have done that again. It was a one-shot deal. But I still had them, I said, “Are you sure this is everything? What about this image here?” the little brain etching that’s illustrated in tons of things. “Oh no, we never saw that.” Two years later, “Oh, we found this. Do you know what this is?” “That’s what I’ve been asking you about.” [laughter] Other things had turned up, so we kept adding to the, just kept buying the work. And I still wish I could have made a case to get Tuna. That’s my favorite of the supermarket posters. And it’s about that time I said, okay, and at the urging of Steve and Walt, saying, David really needs a serious show; David needs a serious show. So I started proposing these shows, and they were basically turned down and turned down, until finally, in like, 2013 or so, they said, okay, we’ll go ahead and do it. And finally we got the show. And it’s one of the reasons I wanted to do this show was that I kept looking at the two catalogues. Tongues of Flame is David at his angriest. He is in very bad health, he has just gone through all of these lawsuits and things, dealing with the NEA and the whole thing with the Artists Space show. So he is very angry, and that comes through in the show; though there’s calm in the show, there’s sort of a slant that way. And then the New Museum show seemed to be more of the – it’s unfair for me to say it this way, but I thought it was a little more on the incidental side. I don’t want to say sex, sex, sex, but it’s the seamier side of the East Village. And the more I kept looking at David and thinking about the work and seeing images of the work, I kept saying, David is one of these important voices. And when I did the I, You, We on the ‘80s up at the Breuer building, from the collection, part of that was inspired by David. Because there were two focus rooms, one was AIDS and one was Nan Goldin. And as I started thinking about it and looking at it, Nan and David are two of the most important voices of the ‘80s. There’s other great artists going on: Gober, Kiki Smith, or whatever. There are other great artists working. But the people who seem to really capture that funny moment of the ‘80s, were David and Nan. And they have now, I call it “rehabilitated” Mapplethorpe. Everyone sees Keith Haring, party, party, party, Basquiat. David is hard. David I don’t think will ever be put back – people have a hard time with him because yes, there are some very strong pictures. I think the artwork is very strong. But the controversy was really not about the pictures. The controversy was about his texts. And that is something that you can’t whitewash. You can whitewash Mapplethorpe and just say, “Oh, aren’t they just gorgeous formalisms!” You can’t whitewash someone who has written, and his writing is so strong. And that is why he deserves a show where you’ve seen the work in a very positive formal way where the texts and the images are really seen as coming out of the same brain. And what a brain. And especially an artist, someone who is basically a self-educated person. And so that was my goal for the show, to really – I think people expected me to do a pier show. And the more I got into thinking about it, the piers are only an incident. And when you read David, he’s talking about, the piers were his escape. He would go there to write. When everyone else started invading his pier, he moved to another pier, because it was his escape. Being in New York, it was the closest he could get out to no urban. And I really wanted David to be seen as someone who is very important, not the sort of incidental, oh, that’s the last hide-and-seek incident. That is taking David out of context. You have to look at David in context and see the whole David. And so I’m hoping that that’s what this show does. I think when Breslin and I started stalking about the catalogue, I said I really want it to go beyond the sort of flash. I wanted it to be sort of serious. I said, as far as I was concerned, the texts should all be different, handled differently, taking different focuses, but when you take them together you start to see a better image of David. And I think that is what he needs. And I have to also say thank you to Tom Rauffenbart who kept saying, “David was a goofball.” And you realize, as you go through it, that that whole side of David has not – people don’t know that, and it’s under there the whole time, there is that goofball side of him. He was a big kid. And I’m hoping that that’s what this show has done, or will do when we get it up. I just can’t wait to see it. I’ve been living it now, it seems like, well, I had a whole year where I couldn’t do much except try to get off of crutches, so I was not as focused as I should have been. But I now feel like I have – I don’t think I’ve read C. Carr’s biography from page one to page end, but I think I’ve read most of it multiple times, not spot checking, but just diving in in bits. David has just become – in a funny way, I need to let him go a little bit. [laughter] \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[16:25]\nDi:\tThat actually ran through the next couple of questions I had, but it brings me to, and I guess you were starting to discuss this, how did the decision, the way you’re setting this show against the previous retrospectives, how did it affect decisions for the checklist?\nDK:\tI know that before I fell and had the long hospital stay, I had gone through all, in fact, I have a list, if we were thinking about showing this, was it shown in this one? Was it actually in the show? Was it in just illustrations? How did it fall? There is quite a bit of duplication, I would think. You can’t get away from it; there are only fifteen years. The one area that I wish we could have done more, but in a funny way it’s a transitional period, is ’82 to ’84, where the work is a little – we have it in there with the early sort of violence against gay people in the Village, in the jails. But just a little bit. That’s a whole period that we – I was getting limited in space, and you can only do so much. So I had to make a choice. But I think there’s a number of things that no one has seen in the real flesh, and I think you have – ’99 is a long time ago. Looking at younger artists today, they think they’ve invented the wheel? No; David’s under there; they just don’t know it. And I think that’s one of the reasons we asked Hanya to write her piece for us, as a writer who, in A Little Life, it channels David without – she had never read David, she had never looked at David, though the cover is a Peter Hujar photograph. And we asked her if she would be willing to do it, and she totally flipped out in doing it. I mean, she wrote a most magnificent piece about what David means, how he opens your eyes and what he means.\nMT:\tIt was clear in the Keeper exhibition that’s up at the New Museum right now, that the one artist who did the notebooks, the young Japanese artist, is so influenced by Wojnarowicz. In looking at them, it was uncanny.\nDi:\tYes; I went there. Have you seen that? You’ll like that room. It’s cut and pasted journals that do remind me of the way he would rearrange comics and paint over them, that kind of layering.\nMT:\tYes, absolutely.\nDi:\tSo, Wojnarowicz has frequently been discussed or framed as an artist for whom art and life were deeply entwined. How are you approaching biography in the exhibition? Are you including his personal life details within the space of the show? Within the space of the book?\nDK:\tIt’s in the book. We asked, David did his own version of his biography for the Tongues of Flame, And it was definitely his looking at his life and, as Tom says, he never lied. However, he shifts the truth around a little bit. [they laugh] He has something to say; he’s trying to make a point, what he’s been going through. So that is very focused in there. And Cynthia did this – no one can ever repeat what she did, and there was no reason for us to redo the biography. So what we asked Cynthia to do was, in the book, we have David’s published version of his life, which stops in 1982, because that’s when he considers himself an artist. That’s the first sort of statement: I’m an artist. Which I thought was very interesting, that he stops it in ’82, where the work in the show first takes up. We had C. Carr, what she did was to – she’s in the column on the other side. His column is in what we call the David font. Any time David’s voice is being in the book, we use the David font, and then we have everybody-else’s font. And so she is replying, expanding, elaborating, all the way through. And then after ’82, sort of does a summation of it all. The other thing we’ve done is, the exhibition history for him is very quirky, what you can find either from galleries or in the books. And we basically, I spent like two weeks going through East Village Eye and looking for every reference that I could, to David, for an exhibition, because the Lower East Side, that whole period, there were a lot of pop-up shows. There were a lot of one-nighters or one-weekenders or whatever. And so I started collecting that, and then we had graduate students doing further. And I must say, a month ago, I still found some more. I was reading an obituary on Frank Wagner in Berlin, and I’m going through, and they’re talking about his shows. And they talk about his interest in the Lower East Side and David Wojnarowicz; there was a whole list of shows, two of which were not on our exhibition list. They are now on the exhibition list because when I could get the documentation, David was in them. The same thing with the bibliography; we really pushed and pieced it. But it’s to try to – my idea is that part of knowing David is to know seeing this mass of what these exhibitions were, because no one thinks – now when they think of Lower East Side, they’re all trust fund kids in their condos, not the same thing as it was then. Maybe it was a little bit more like Bushwick, but Bushwick is also trust-funders. This was scrappy; this was a scrappy time. And I think that when you start taking all of the parts together you get a better idea of, you get a larger read of David. I don’t think we want it to come out as a definitive statement on David, because David, again, as Tom said, when he was talking to you, he was talking to you. When he was talking to Marvin, he was talking to Marvin, but it was maybe a slightly different tinge on the story. When he was talking to Tom, he was talking about something else. So you can’t do a definitive statement on him, you have to do this sort of triangulating the evidence. [they laugh] And I hope that’s what’s going to come across in the show. The show will be laid out somewhat in a chronology, starting with the early work, the Rimbauds. We’re not going back to the early odd sketches and all that because that’s almost like – they were David sketching in his writing, but not as formal artwork. Going from there to the stencils on various things, the show will be more than a chronology building up. After the Peter Hujar, the Peter Dreaming room, there is what I want to call – I’m hoping we can make it into what I call the long gallery at the Frick, the formal period that David really is being  a historical painter. And I think that’s something that people haven’t focused on, is that in a way, he’s in the grand tradition of the 16th and 17th centuries, 18th century, of the historical paintings. And it’s not recording events, it’s recording the four seasons, the four elements, the humours, treating things in somewhat of an allegorical way, of talking about man’s damaging the natural environment, all of these things that were part and parcel of treating it in a very, I consider it grand historical tradition.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[26:18]\nDi:\tCynthia Carr refers to the 1987 show at Gracie Mansion as the history painting show. She puts quotes around it, and I had been wondering if that was her term or his term?\nDK:\tI think that was probably – I don’t know if it was his term. But they were history paintings, but those are the later ones, and it starts even earlier. So things like The Worker, the show that was at Anna Friebe, those are all history paintings. The Mexican show is all history paintings. Someone will probably say, why didn’t you put in the Science work, the one that was in the ’84 Biennial? First of all, the person who owns it is totally off the wall and crazy. [MT and Di laugh] And also, it’s so big. We had to think about, if we’re going to travel the show, and getting as much work in as we could, we couldn’t have something – the other thing is, David didn’t paint small. In the early work, a lot of it is 48x48, which is the size of Masonite that you get at the lumberyard. Or he would get for free from his friends who were working backstage in the theater district. Also the tarps came a certain way, and he was painting on tarps. So, he didn’t have the money, but he did as much as he could. I think the museum thought all of this work is small and ittle bitty things. Unh-unh. 48 by 48 is a pretty good size. There weren’t that many people working 48x48.\nDi:\tEven supermarket posters are bigger than I thought, when I looked at the dimensions. Yeah, they’re huge. I was just seeing the small image; I didn’t realize how big they were.\nDK:\tSo that gallery is going to culminate in the four elements, Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. And I really want them in a gallery that these just are totally surrounded. I think when MoMA showed them the last time, they had them in a straight line. I want you to feel like you are in a special room in Versaille or in a palace of something where this is a special chamber and you are surrounded by the Four Elements as an allegorical sequence. Then go into the area that starts Peter; I’m now thinking of calling it Life and Death. Because you have Jane Dickson’s painting of the large hand holding a fetus. It’s also in his – he had a niece, I think, born – Pat had a niece. And also, Jane had her kid. So there are these -- that’s life. It’s also, right after that, first Peter is diagnosed, but then Tom was diagnosed, and David came later, being diagnosed. So, they’re starting to really get the dealing with the idea of death. And then you have Peter dying, Peter dead. And then he goes forward again on the next phase, but he doesn’t really incorporate photography into the work until after Peter dies. I think that was sort of a Peter thing. Peter was the mentor, father, brother, teacher, uncle, whatever. And then that, to me – and I’m hoping we can have all four Flowers, if we can -- just that the one that’s in Munich is big. __[30:20] But if the show travels only to Europe, then it would make sense to borrow it here. But that is sort of like the counterpoint to the Four Elements, are the Four Flowers, with some of his really vicious texts. I don’t want to say “vicious” in a nasty way, but it’s strong. And it’s where the marvelous sequence – Cynthia talks about how he has a studio in the, I forget now, the kid who works for Barry who finds him a studio and his own student.\nMT:\tRight. I don’t remember his name\nDK:\tAnd he talks about how David painted those. And I think they’re absolutely – there’s a show happening in one of the French museums about vicious flowers or something which, they want to borrow the one in Munich. And I don’t think they get it. Because what’s so marvelous to me about those works, and it’s explained, is how he had the photographs that he had taken in the Botanical Gardens in Washington. So he had these really exotic, almost sexual, flowers. They remind me of the Kuniyoshi lilies that are painted in the bathrooms, women’s bathrooms, in Radio City Music Hall. That sort of over-the-top, sexual art deco flowers. So you’re in this room. He had projected them, he outlined them, and then he painted. But they’re painting of a kind that David isn’t normally – you don’t associate with David; you think of him as being rough. So you have these fabulous flowers, and you look at them and they’re like decadently gorgeous. As you get closer, you realize that all of those little inset panels are sewn in with thread, which are, he’s been mining basically his photo archive, his old contact sheets, for appropriate images. So they’re mounted on there. Now that he has Peter’s darkroom, he can print what he wants. So they’re mounted inside. So now you’ve gone through the first step; you’ve seen these exotic flowers. Next thing, as you get closer, you’re starting to realize there’s another story layering of these photographs; what are they telling you? And then, you get closest to it, and you see the text. And the texts just kick you in the balls. Because they are – in those four pictures, he is really, I think he’s transcending almost any other painter I know at that time. They are really powerful pictures to me. And then after that comes, sort of sliding to the end. But I think people will come away – we’re not going to close – the Head in the Dust is going to be in the last room, but it’s not, like, the last picture we really want to let people end with is One Day This Kid. Which, that and the Bandaged Hands, which was worked on his last sort of of the three major big pictures that Gary Snyder was working with him on, was the last one to be done. It was never shown until after his death. And I am hoping that by the time people get through, as I had hoped in the AIDS room at I, You, We, I wanted people to be in tears. I really wanted people to  be in tears, and there were a number of people in tears. That’s why we put the Haring altar at the end, because it was a bit of resurrection. And I think David’s, well, One Day This Kid was always the goal; I wanted that in the collection anyway. And it is a really affirmative statement, in a funny, way, after all of the negativity of some of those late texts. He’s riled up. He’s riled up in there, too, but it’s a very calm, logical statement. And I want people to come away saying: You know, this guy really, it’s gonna make me think. And that is, then, the goal all along. I may not be the world’s most beautiful writer with quoting 55 different French philosophers, but my little essays in there are really ort of just pointing out things so that people have something to latch onto, and then see, oh, that’s over here, the language that he uses. Because it is a visual language, as much as his verbal language is a verbal language.\t\t\t[35:55]\nDi:\tGosh. Thank you so much for the tour of the exhibition. We got the virtual tour. Particularly ending with that, thinking about the flower paintings then sort of operating on, because it’s not just operating on a language of painting. It’s operating on a language of photography and a language of text and the way he integrates those is unlike any artist.\nDK:\tI don’t know of any artist who has been able to really do that. Barbara Kruger to some degree, but not, I mean, that’s coming out of advertising. This is really deep thinking, and also, it’s program. To do those paintings he had to really have a sense of progression in a way that I think very few artists have ever thought. Because you are moving as you approach them, you are progressing through – he’s setting up little stages for you, of growing awareness of what this is all about.\nMT:\tWhen I think about Wojnarowicz’s work what always strikes me is the sense of time that’s always there in each work, because of what you’re saying, there’s also a sense of moving in time and moving in complexity as you get closer to the painting. But he’s obsessed with time. It comes up in the writing everywhere, and I think it’s in a lot of the work. Even when he would go to the photo booths and have the photos taken of himself again and again,\nDK:\tYes.\nMT:\tI think it’s about time, and he does it at intervals in his life, and pastes them into the journals. So there’s some fixation. Well, and the use of clocks, clock faces.\nDK:\tBut clock faces often without hands.\nMT:\tYes. Right. Altering notions of time, in the way he alters the geography and maps.\nDK:\tAnd then, I think Tommy’s picture of Something From Sleep III where you have, it’s a dream image, and Tom finally said, “David, just paint the damn thing.” So his upstairs neighbor was a teacher -- it’s all documented; I’ve quoted what Tom told me – a science teacher in public school, and he had antique microscopes. So David takes a photograph of this guy looking through the microscope. The other funny thing about that painting, it’s totally painted. There’s no collage on it. And when you look at the painting, you have this outline of a man obviously looking into the microscope which is painted. On the front part there’s like a wall, and looking through him, and you see space. And what you realize is – but now that it’s cleaned you can see the blue outline of his figure a little bit. It’s Star Trek where they go through the thing when there’s that point where they are here and then not here. There’s at that point of zap. And that painting is all about that point of zap, that point of, where are you? And I don’t know if David – I haven’t looked at what he had in his library, but I’m really curious if he had some of this, was reading about that kind of theories about time and how what’s out here is coming – in a funny way, it’s a reverse, going through this way. And of going fast and going backwards, going forwards and backwards at the same time.\nMT:\tAnd he talks about that in Close to the Knives.\nDK:\tYeah. It’s a real -- to me that’s a fabulous picture.\nMT:\tYes, it really is. I hadn’t seen it in years, and when you said it, yeah, of course, I saw it in Tom’s apartment; that’s where I saw it. I knew I had seen it before but I hadn’t seen it in a long time.\nDi:\tHad it been shown before?\nDK:\tIt was shown in the 1989 show that has the Xeroxed catalogue. It was in there. It’s called Tommy’s Picture in parentheses. And I think that’s the last time it’s been seen. I don’t know of many people even who went to see that show. So I think it’s a new one for a lot of people.\nDi:\tIt’s very contemplative.\nDK:\tOh, to me, it’s just (sigh). You start working with David, as I’m sure Marvin knows, you start working with David and you can’t leave him, really. He’s always going to be there. He has a way of – he has something that’s very sort of __[41:15]  human about him, in the grand German way of saying the word.\nMT:\tYes, absolutely.\nDK:\tHe hits a chord that is in all of us; whatever you are, it’s there. It’s something that we share as being human. We may not think about it; we may think about a lot of other things. But he really hits a human quality.\nDi:\tWell actually, I thought we could track back a little bit, too, into earlier in the career and sort of earlier moments in the show, as well. In your research process you had mentioned the East Village scene as, it’s not something that exists now, and I forget if you used the word “messy” but it was more, um,\nDK:\tAd hoc.\nDi:\tAd hoc, yes, we’ll use as hoc. And there was a lot of collaboration. So clearly, also at that time, the gallery scene looked and smelled and felt different than the beautiful new Whitney downtown. And I was wondering what you thought about the contrast in environment, if it was something that you felt you needed to consider, working with an artist like Wojnarowicz who is so associated with that period and that particular gallery scene?\t\t\t[42:53]\nDK:\tI don’t think we need to go to a lot of degree of making it look messy. I think the work, in a funny way, just in his materials and the way he works, gives that, more so than Basquiat would or Haring. There is something very sort of scrappy about his work, because he had no money. He was scrounging. Like those globes. In one of the editorial things back and forth, they said: Can we say Walgreens or is it Woolworths? And I said, well I know that Walgreens was definitely in the Midwest when I grew up at that time, but I’m not sure, but maybe we have to just say Woolworths. He could have gotten from a dollar store type thing. I had no evidence, but I talked about cheap, like those big dollar bills and twenty-dollar bills and thousand-dollar play money. He probably had sheets that he got, but then he went to the copy shop, which they all did. I mean, Todd’s Copy Shop was really busy, which is why he did that set of very formal stencil pictures; he had to pay off his bill. But the little ad, the announcement for it, he was doing something with, Peter Fend was up at the same time, and it’s very interesting.\nDi:\tThe show was at Todd’s Copy Shop?\nDK:\tAt Todd’s. I don’t know if David had a show, as much, but the flyer has the camouflage rock pattern in it that definitely comes out about the same point; it’s something he’s playing with. But it’s all David. And is the paper great? One of ours is in great condition because it hadn’t been put on the wall. The other three are a little tingey because someone had them up on the wall. It’s not the greatest paper but it is better than I think he would normally have used. It was a big pad, and you could go through and take out the ones that you wanted. They were $5 apiece, I think, is what I was told that people paid for them. So he could pay off this Copy Shop bill. [they laugh]\nDi:\tAlong the lines of that question, a lot, especially in this mid-80s period, or even in the ’89, the Decade show at the New Museum, a lot of Wojnarowicz’s exhibitions took the form of site-specific installations. So how are you approaching the site specificity of Wojnarowicz’s work? I know that you’ve made the decision not to recreate installations that are not extant, so I guess if you could tell us more about that decision.\nDK:\tI decided, it came up early with the show, the Decade show, the one that has the little skeleton in it. We can’t get all of the pieces. Also, when Elisabeth Sussman did the Paul Thek show, could you – the idea of recreating something, what you can’t recreate is – it’s almost you’re becoming a voyeur. You’re looking in on something that is totally now alien, because it doesn’t have, you can’t recreate the sense of what it was, what was in the air at the time, what the physical space felt like. We now have these beautiful white galleries. Can you duplicate a scrappy storefront, which is what New Museum was? It’s something that you can’t recreate that time. After PPOW did the installation at Frieze from the Mnuchin installation, I got phone call after phone call: Oh, we have to have one of those installations; Oh, we have to have an installation. And I kept saying no. What was missing there was David was so grossed out by this opulence of this Upper East Side life. He and his buddies collected garbage off the street, complete with cockroaches and rats and other things, and that is what is physically missing in that kind of thing. Well, you can’t do that in a museum. And the whole impact of that would be different now. I don’t think you could really recreate any of those late ones.\nMT:\tOne of the things that we were talking about with James and Marguerite was that the installations that he did for them also had a smell component that you could never recreate. Because the one that he did with the Richard Kern film in the background, and I think it was Number 8, was that the one? Installation Number 8? Had dog shit that they brought in off the street, that was outside the wall, there was a wall and you looked through the broken window. And then there was the table with the Thanksgiving dinner set up, which sat there rotting for a whole month. Yeah, there was this whole other aspect, so how do you recreate that?\nDK:\tI remember being in Luzern and seeing the Paul Thek, they own a large part of the Paul Thek installation which he did there, which had live chickens in it. And of course they didn’t have the live chickens. In a funny way, it didn’t feel right. Because you saw the cage, but there were no chickens. If you’ve been out on a farm, you’re having to walk into the chicken yard and then into the chicken coop. There was no chicken shit on the floor. And this is the stuff that was missing. And you just cannot, it’s not something you can recreate. And I think we have to, my feeling is, you vicariously live through it through what images survive, and that’s it.\t\t[49:40]\nMT:\tI’ve made a point of never having people recreate performance work here. I don’t want to see somebody in their eighties recreate something that they did in their twenties, and I don’t especially want to see somebody else do it. I’d rather just have documentation.\nDK:\tI think I totally agree. Because there’s this evolution, again, of time. You’re used to certain things, and then it starts looking dated, and the vocabulary is constantly changing. And I think the impact is lost, that impact of the period.\nMT:\tThere is a question that I don’t have an answer to, of how this differs from dance and opera, which we re-perform all the time. But to me there is a difference with performance art and with installation kinds of things.\nDK:\tI think I agree.\nMT:\tAnd I don’t know exactly why I feel that, but I do.\nDK:\tSomeone told me there was a re-creation of that Lucinda Childs, Sol Lewitt and Phil Glass piece that was first done at BAM. I remember going to it. And someone said, oh, well you should go out and see it again. And I said, no. Because there was something very, very interesting when you saw it for the first time. Now everyone does it. But there was something very striking about it, and it wasn’t totally smooth. I also had a long talk before she died with Elizabeth Murray about when one of the Denby plays was done at St. Marks, where she did the sets. And she was amazed that someone could – I said, those sets have always lived with me. They’re there, I mean, they relate to the paintings, in a funny way, but no one ever talks about them. But you can’t recreate that play. I said, that play meant a lot to me. It’s always lived there. I always think about it. And she said, that’s what it’s really about. The idea of recreating is just – besides, David reused everything, like Paul Thek did, too.\t\t\t\t\t\t[52:10]\nMT:\tThis has been an issue with this entire project. How do you structure a knowledge base about Wojnarowicz’s work? Because he reuses things. And some things get described sometimes as works, but what happens when they’re in an installation and then moved to another installation, and so it’s really about relationships between objects and things, and not about complete works.\nDK:\tI think the Burning Child, there’s some debate if there’s one, two, or three of them.\nMT:\tMm-hm. Yes.\nDK:\tAnd it’s unclear.\nMT:\tThe child skeleton, we know it was used in installations but we did see it in photographs and other things, too.\nDK:\tI almost think that our version of One Day This Kid, which is, when we bought it, there were two in the estate, one signed and one not signed. And I haven’t been able to find measurements for the one that’s shown in the Decade show. But I think ours is – we bought the unsigned one because I knew that collectors will only buy a signed one. But I knew where this came from. I have a sneaking suspicion we may have that one, but I’m not sure. Because there’s no pinholes to put it up on the wall. But then he may have cut them off.\nMT: \tMm-hm. [laughs]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[53:35]\nDi:\tSo this introduces a little bit one of the challenges we’ve been working with with the knowledge base that I’m sure you encountered organizing a retrospective as a curator in a museum who is used to working with traditional art historical categories, which is that Wojnarowicz’s central impulse was to disrupt boundaries, disrupt categories, to work outside of traditional modes. Did you find that a challenge, as you were thinking – it sounds as though the way you’re organizing the show is thematically and loosely chronologically. But is there a sort of desire to talk about Wojnarowicz as a photographer; Wojnarowicz as a painter?\nDK:\tNo, because I think, coming from the way I have approached printmaking at the Whitney, which is, I don’t think anyone else really does it that way, I go from the artist. If the artist wants to call it a print; fine. It could be an edition. It could be a sculpture. I’m not setting up – if I were only collecting technique? How boring. [MT and Di laugh] And for someone like Wojnarowicz, he used whatever method that he needed. He wanted to work on those banged up trash can lids. Peter __[55:18] said, replace the lid.\nMT:\tRight; yes.\nDK:\tBut to me, I’m not going to set up a category. I think it’s the semi-educated who have to have a category for everything. [MT and Di laugh] We did run into this when doing the index. Do we call these stencils, or are they paintings? And if he referred to them as painting, they went in the paintings.\nMT:\tMm-hm.\nDi:\tAnd those trash cans lids were painted?\nDK:\tWe put them under sculpture because it was just easier to deal with them that way. We could only go so far. We had to make it logical a little bit.\nDi:\tHow are they displayed, by the way?\nDK:\tWe put two little nails up here and here, put it up, and then have something, a bracket, to hold it on.\nDi:\tSo they hang on the wall.\nDK:\tWe’re going to hang them on the wall.\nDi:\tIs that how the owners of the work are displaying them?\nDK:\tI think some have. Who knows?\nDi:\tThey’re such unusual pieces.\nDK:\tIt was interesting, when they did the Science Lesson globe, the Tony Ganz’s, he was there and there were endless shots of that because it’s on all three sides. He had his favorite view. We wanted the Running Figure to come through, and I think Julie Ault shows another side of it. There is no right side to it. We had a back and forth with the photographers. They were shooting the Loaf of Bread. Well, I’m going to try to get this much paper up here and this much – because it’s a period newspaper from the date. And so we wanted to really get you to see the whole sheet of newsprint, but Tony was right there. That’s a great collector who really feels involved with the work. He said, ‘No, you’re absolutely right; we don’t want to block out the top of the sheet. We want to be able to show the bread is really sitting on the sheet so you get the feeling of the sheet.’\nMT:\tBecause every one of those things was meticulously chosen. It’s like the wolf’s head, the pieces that were used to create it, were all carefully – pieces of newspaper headlines taken by David and put together very, very intentionally.\t\t\t\t\t[58:00]\nDK:\tI feel like in putting this show together, I’ve only barely touched David in some things. I regret that I didn’t spend a lot more time at Fales, because, but I had so many other things to do, and in a funny way, you have to sort of close off certain things. You can get too involved into – like his Magic Box. I mean, I think that’s something very important, but you get too involved in, why is this and not this; what is this and what is that? My goal was to set him up in a formal way, so that other people can do it. I just hope they don’t – I get a little tired of reading about sort of the same things over and over again with him. I don’t think that in the show up at the Bronx that they totally understand David in what those two works are about. Definitely no mention of Peter Hujar __[59:18]  It’s like they didn’t even notice that. And in the St. Sebastian, they were all getting off on the gay issue of it, and it’s part of the story but it isn’t the whole story with that.\nMT:\tThey tend to do that with David way too much.\nDK:\tYes, and I want to bring David into the general discussion of what were the ‘80s and what were they about, and this whole thing about identity and thought that you get both in him and with Nan. Once you get through all of the different layers going on, you’re getting a real sense of someone who’s really thinking about what it was to be alive, with or without AIDS, with or without everything, and having money or no money. What was it like to be this kind of person? Because I think it tells us a lot about what it is today.\t\t\t\t[1:00:45]\nDi:\tThat sort of gets to, my last question was going to be, what do you see as the essential recurring themes that he dealt with. But I think we’ve been sort of addressing that. I also would want to go back thinking about what has to be closed off, or also addressing this question of time and what can be recreated or not. There’s also the issue of Wojnarowicz’s time-based media that he worked with, in terms of film and video, and I believe that’s also something that you’ve made a decision not to focus on within the retrospective. There might be a screening program, it sounded like.\nDK:\tI really have trouble with – it’s a personal thing, but I’ve listened to a few people in galleries, and Ken Griffin said it really succinctly. He says, ‘Why do they have all of this moving imagery? It takes away; you don’t get to focus on that which isn’t moving.’ Because we’ve raised a whole generation of television people. You watch them in a gallery; the minute they see a moving image, their concentration changes.\nMT:\tMm-hm.\nDK:\tAnd since there are so few complete David – there are some wonderful snips, but complete David film? No.\nMT:\tThere are basically two. Or three.\nDK:\tITSOFOMO,\nMT:\tBeautiful People, and Heroin.\nDK:\tWhich is probably too violent to put up on the wall. We’d have to put up: Be sure Johnny and Sally don’t come near this; they may have bad dreams. [laughter]\nMT:\tAnd actually, some of his most beautiful footage is footage that was just never used in anything, just stunning footage.\nDK:\tI think that is why I’m thinking of just having, if we can do, or what we want to do is sort of a series of small things. Like I can see having maybe two sessions about ITSOFOMO on a Friday night or something, and have people come and talk about it. Or the Richard Kern films. And treat them like a little classroom session. The one that I have to admit I’m going to admit I’m going to hopefully be in here this fall to look at it because I really have to look at all of these. I know David Breslin looked at them. But the __[1:03:38] for Peter.\nMT:\tWhich is deeply problematic, because Jon Gartenburg fooled around with the footage when he was working on its preservation a long time ago with Manny [?] from Visual AIDS, and so we know what David had, and Brent went through and undid what Gartenburg had done, because Gartenburg had strung them together as though it was a completed work, which it wasn’t.\nDK:\tIt sounds like Fire in the Belly.\nMT:\tYes, well, it’s very similar. And we asked John for the documentation. He would never give us his documentation on the decisions he made.\nDK:\tWe don’t want to deny that David did use a film camera, but in a funny way what this show is doing is setting up a legitimate body of work. And I think this is where we need to figure out, now that we’ve had this delay in when the show happens, that we have the luxury of sitting back, and very definitely we will be talking with Fales, because they have more expertise in this. And I think the solution is going to be something that we very closely talk about so that we are in agreement. Because, like with titles, where I finally brow-beat decisions, like all the Arthur Rimbauds, I had all these little subtexts. And I finally said, you know, what did David show? What did he call these? He always refers to the Arthur Rimbaud in New York, but he doesn’t say “at the piers” or “at Coney Island.” What did he, how did he want them referred to? And they said, ‘Oh, we put those subtitles on so we knew which ones to sell.’\nDi:\tYeah.\nMT:\tI know.\nDK:\tSo I said, okay, off they all go. Let’s just call them the Arthur Rimbauds in New York. Same thing with the Ant series. He showed them as Faith, Hope, Charity, whatever, Commodity. He had real titles for them that were – so we’re saying “Untitled” and then in parentheses is what he called them. Because those titles have meaning to when you’re looking at them, and heaven forbid the Christian right comes after us with ants on the cross again because he made very clear choices.\nMT:\tAnd in the letter about Fire in My Belly, he talks about the ants and the ants [salving?] Christ’s wounds. It’s the exact opposite of what they made it out to be.\nDK:\tIt’s sort of like the rich man, poor Lazarus, where the dogs were licking his legs. Dogs were, that was the cheapest pharmacist that you could get in Near Eastern society. There is the sense of healing, that nature is healing.\nMT:\tAnd it’s incredibly important for him.\nDK:\tOh, all the way through.\nMT:\tThat restorative force of nature.\nDK:\tYes. We’re not going to be able to borrow Danny Buchholz’s Earth, Wind, Fire and Water, because it’s so big. But we wanted to illustrate it there because it’s about the destruction and the restoration of nature, and how nature really will – I want to sit there and say, if David were alive today, what would he be saying about global warming? Because he was talking about global warming in the ‘80s. The only two artists I know talking about that stuff were David and Frank Moore, Frank coming from a much more scientific background and having gone to college and focused on that, David coming from an innate sense of nature. But both of them are saying so much, and people dismiss them. They only want to see David the Keith Haring party girl, and it’s not party girl here. That’s just sort of an aspect of his personality and that’s life, and let’s get on with what he wanted to focus on, which was his work. He had things to say. And I think he was probably very frustrated at the end that he couldn’t say it all.\nMT:\tYes, you get that sense from the archive, that he was creating and creating and creating, and it was very frustrating as he got debilitated and couldn’t. We found what we think is his last note, written the day he died. And the handwriting looks like somebody who is in their late nineties, by that point. And it’s a little bit of poetry, and it’s really beautiful. Lisa and I found it, and we were like, oh my god.\nDK:\tI think C. Carr may have put that into her, or Julie may have.\nMT:\tI don’t think we found it until after both of those – I mean, this was within the past six months that we found it.\nDK:\tI know there’s an image that says “David’s last work.”\nMT:\tThere is, okay, oh, you mean she may have put it in your book.\nDK:\tThe illustration.\nMT:\tYes, because that would have been since we discovered it.\nDK:\tAnd it’s really, because he can’t even keep to the lines.\nMT:\tRight. It’s really moving.\nDK:\tYes, he’s someone who’s quite incredible. I just hope – there are other people who know a lot more about him, and I just hope that they give me credit for doing the best job I could with it.\nDi:\tWell I have a couple of sort of boring questions that I was skipping over, but maybe I’ll just return to them to make sure we hit them before the end. Because part of what we’re trying to gather is advice or information for future conservators, curators. So I was wondering if, in your research, you discovered preferences that Wojnarowicz expressed regarding the display of his works in terms of hanging or framing or placement.\nDK:\tThe only thing I know about are like the Neil’s set of Sex Series, he has a set that’s framed in David’s choice of frames. And we’ll order up frames to match them. I thing Steve and Walt have an Ant series that are using frames that David – I’m not sure if it’s David’s master set or what, but they’re blue and black frames. But for the most part, he was painting on Masonite, and if you look on the backside, it’s sort of fun, because you have, he’s gone out on the street and scavenged but he’ll have strips to sort of balance and counter-balance the weight so that the Masonite doesn’t __.[1:11:37] [laughter] The grommets, I think Dan Voe’s painting is on four-foot by four-foot Masonite, but it has grommets that you can, you know. David, certainly no gold frames. [laughter] I think probably any framing where we don’t – because a lot of the stuff was pinned to the wall, the posters; we can’t do that, obviously, so they will be framed. But hopefully – I’m not going to do the decorator job of saying, “Oh, you have to only do it this way. We’ve got one and one so you have to have two green frames.” No. These are personal choices. Unless it’s a hideous gold frame. I think the, Pascal’s drawing on the Wardline Pier paper of Slam for Slam Kick, it’s just in sort of a wooden frame, and he’s just going to reframe it simply. But you have to with works on paper. But no. And hanging? The pictures that got sent to me for In the Garden showed it very crowded.\nDi:\tYes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1:13:13]\nDK:\tI think the only time he was really specific was when he did Metamorphosis with the bull’s eye, and then the shelf fell, because they didn’t have a support for the shelf. Unless you know of anything like that.\nMT:\tThe only thing I know is that when I talked to Barry Blenderman he said that David wasn’t really involved in installation at their retrospective out there.\nDi:\tWendy also said he installed his exhibitions in the space and he came in with an idea of what he wanted. But I agree, they look pretty crowded, and it might not have been a display decision as much as, these are the works in the show and they all have to go up.\nDK:\tYeah. I think In the Garden there is the image showing the show, photographing the show, and there is a wall in the front, and it’s a tribute wall to Peter. It has “Peter Hujar, dead” and there’s a vase with a dead flower. And I’m toying with the idea of having a little vase with a dead flower, but that’s a little corny; you can’t do that today. But one thing I’m hoping is that – last time I went up to see Tommy, Anita was there. And fell in love with Anita; Anita is just wonderful. And I said, we hope that on the outside of the show we’ll be able to show David’s two, the panel for Keith Davis and for Peter, that he did. So we’ll have the two large sections of the AIDS thing. And I said, “Tom, maybe you can finish your panel.” “Oh, I don’t know if I can . . . .” And Anita said, “Tom, I’ll help you. But you’ve got to do it for David.” Because there is no AIDS panel for David, because Tom was going to do it.\nMT:\tYes, and then Tom himself was very sick; and then got better.\t\t\t[1:15:30]\nDK:\tAnd got better. It is a story of survival, for everything. The Fales, taking it, what you all did, really meant the survival of – that we can now go back and really give David his place. Because I think ten years ago, or the mid-nineties, no one would have cared. Whatever New Museum did would have been the story for David. And I think now, with the way that the archive has been looked at, focused on, worked with, I’m benefitting, and I think we’re going to come away with a much fuller idea of David. And I keep saying maybe I should start working on the catalogue raisonné of the work. But, I can start it; I don’t know if I could ever finish it.\nMT:\tUh-huh; uh-huh. It’s going to be difficult.\nDK:\tWhere do you cut off on what is a drawing?\nMT:\tYep.\nDK:\tAnd then how much work is still in people’s back closets?\nDi:\tHow much of the work that’s in the archive here is work that it goes into the catalogue raisonné, or not?\nDK:\tYes.\nMT:\tThat’s a question.\nDi:\tWell, I have one more boring question, and then maybe we’ll do final thoughts. Are you okay on time?\nMT:\tI’m already late, so.\nDK:\tOh, I’m sorry. I talk too much.\nMT:\tThat’s all right; no.\nDi:\tYou might not even have an answer for this boring question, but it’s if you’ve encountered specific conservation problems that are kind of specific to Wojnarowicz, in the course of planning the show.\nDK:\tWell, we originally were thinking that we wanted to travel the show to three places, another place in the United States, and two in Europe. And we had sent out a preliminary request to LA County, and they said, our work can only go to three places, you and two others. And that was a big signal, because 75 percent of this is paper. Even if it’s collaged, it’s paper on other things, even though, yeah, some of it is protected; there’s varnishes and other things on top, it’s still paper.\nDi:\tEven the paintings have paper.\nDK:\tThey’re not straightforward paintings, most of them.\nDi:\tSculptures have paper.\nDK:\tThey’re Masonite with paper put on top and then drawing, collage, painting on top of that. And Tommy’s picture with the microscope is totally paint on canvas, totally paint on canvas. I was afraid to even ting it when I was arranging with him, and our conservator who took off the grime that was on the surface, said, “It’s all paint, and it’s canvas! There’s not a single piece of collage on here.” [laughter] Which is unusual.\nMT:\tVery unusual.\nDi:\tAny sort of final thoughts or notes?\nDK:\tNo, I just say, thank you, Fales. [laughter]\nMT:\tWell, thank you.\nDK:\tI think that, what I’m hoping out of this whole thing, is that we work very closely together, because you can’t do this show, really, without totally interconnecting Web sites, the information. The only way to get the complete – I can’t do the complete picture. They can’t do the complete picture. But putting it together, we can let people begin to get a better picture.\nMT:\tAnd we’re delighted to do that. And I just met with Hugh Ryan, who is going to be our curator, today. So we’ll all get together soon.\nDi:\tWell, thank you so much. I’m going to stop the recording now, then.\nEND at 1:19:45\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_Text_with_David_Kiehl_by_Diana_Kamin_and_Marvin_Taylor_on_8-10-2016&oldid=4304\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterview Text\nThis page was last modified on 12 May 2017, at 09:27.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

I’m Glenn Wharton, here with Marvin Taylor, the Fales Special Collections, NYU. We are here with Marion Scemama to interview her about David Wojnarowicz.\nMT: Thank you, Glenn. Welcome, Marion. It’s lovely to have you here to talk about David Wojnarowicz and his work for the resource we’re trying to build about understanding David’s works. And so we thought we’d start today by asking you about the collaborations that you did with David and about how he worked and how you worked together with him.\nMS: Well, that’s a strong question. How can I start? I think the first collaborations were in photography, because I was a photographer and am still a photographer. So I think David also used me to take photos of ideas he had. Except the first one. The first collaboration we did was about a poster. In fact, the first photos we did we were at the pier. And I wanted to take photos of him for a French magazine. I was doing a story about the East Village. It was at the beginning of 1983. And we met for these photos in, I think, January, 1984. And I wanted to photograph him at Pier 34 where all of the artists’ work was. And he said, “No, no; I’m going to take you to another pier less known. It’s Pier 28. It’s a pier where I went there because there were too many people and it became fashionable to go to Pier 34.” So he took me to that pier, and that’s where there is the image of the pterodactyl. And I took photos in black and white and in color, and portraits of him near the work. And there was a beautiful head of a dog, and also a man with a bird face, and another one was the pterodactyl. So this was more like a journalistic work. And then he asked Civilian Warfare, Dean Savard. He said he was about to have a show and he said that he wanted me to take the photo for the poster. So Dean called me and I went to David’s house. It was on Fourth Street near the Bowery. It was a very small apartment. And when we got in the apartment, there was a kitchen and there were all these plaster heads in the kitchen, and that’s where we did portraits and I did two or three contact sheets on different. And then I had a darkroom at home, and so I printed the photos. He came to my place and we chose the photo for the poster together. This was really the first collaboration work. And I think the poster was a nice one.\nMT: I know it; it’s really beautiful. Those are wonderful photos of him, too. It’s the Forty Heads of State project. Yes. One question I’ve always had is, how did David learn to print photos? I don’t know the history of him printing.\nMS: I think, I guess he learned with Peter. I think so, because I had a darkroom at my place, but he never came to print. He came to my place to paint, because I had a big wall. So sometimes he would come with a canvas and paint; and me, I would be in the darkroom working. We liked that, you know, and we would stop for a coffee, and showing each other what we were doing. And also, you know, the trust between us, for me it started because I loved the pier. I discovered the pier in ’84 – no, it was in ’83. Summer 1983 I spent all of my summer at the pier, going there every day, looking at the sun, of course, to see where the light was coming, at what time, et cetera. And I took a lot of pictures, slides and black-and-white, and I was really, really in love with that place. So there was already a connection with David. And when we met for, after I did the poster, he came to my place and I showed him prints of the photos I took at the pier. And for me, you know, I always have been a journalist photographer, but I never considered myself like an artist, even if I had my own personal work, but it was more for me and my friends, right? And when he saw the photos, he said, “But Marion, you have to take yourself seriously. You are an artist. This is beautiful.” And for me it was like, somebody who said to me, “You’re an artist.” You know? I mean, I could just look at him and say, ‘Well, this guy is great to say that to me;’ you know? So there was a trust like that. And at that moment, I was friends with Catherine Texier and Joel Rose. We were pretty close friends. And they had this magazine Between C & D. And one day they said – they knew I was friends with David, and they said oh, we’d love to have a text from David and make him that he makes a cover for the magazine. And so I talked about that to David and he was really delighted by the idea. He met Joel and Catherine, and then he said, “Let’s make a poster together.” And he had this idea, he had the text. And he had the idea of the photo. So this is more like the way we worked together. I would support him and put my connections, you know, give him my connections and create relationships with people that could support him and help him. And he would, I would say, use me to help him to do what he had in mind. Because he was taking photos at that point, since a long, long time ago. But I think he, maybe because of Peter, he never trusted too much his photography. Maybe because of Peter’s look. You know, like Peter was really in fine art photography, and David was more like snapshots. But I guess he wasn’t afraid of me. He saw my photos; he saw that we could be at the same level; he could trust me. I’m sure that all of the work we did together, it was his concept. And I was there to realize this, to produce this concept with my camera or with discussion. Because we used to speak a lot. We used to speak a lot, and to exchange ideas. And I think this was more the kind of collaboration we had.\nGW: What other kind of work did you do together? There’s the poster and photographs.\nMS: We did a show at T. Greathouse Gallery. There was Greer Lankton in the show, that I was very close with her. And we would meet often with David at my apartment.\nGW: So this was an exhibition.\nMS: Yes, it was an exhibition. So there was Greer Lankton who showed photography, because the gallery was just about photography, and he was the only one in the East Village showing just photography. And David and me, we worked on paintings and photography. So in fact, what we would do is like, David would come to my place. He would have an idea of on Simonite, [? 9:25] do you say that? Like wood, you know? Like he wanted to paint this, or he would come with the painting and show me, and then I would have the idea of a photo I would insert. So he would cut the wood so I could insert the photo. So we worked out the size of the photo, if it would be black-and-white or color, and what would be the content of it. Like, for example, the one that is most published in catalogues is the one I did with him. It’s a painting of the city, I think, with a bridge. You have it in the catalogue. And there’s a photo; the photo I took, it’s a photo of Kiki Smith with a skull projected on her face. It’s a beautiful photo, very strong. And so her face is a skull, but her eyes that are really – it’s a black-and-white photo. And I said to David, you know, I would like – because I knew also the relationship between David and Kiki, and somewhere I wanted Kiki to be present also in this show. I was friends with Kiki, too. And she accepted that I take the photos and use this one. And when I showed the photo to David, he said, “Oh great, yes. We’re going to put it upside-down.” So it’s him who had the idea of putting it upside-down. I think it was a great idea. And then we did another painting with a photo I took in the street of a poster of Michael Roman, a guy screaming. And we did another one that he painted a tornado and a landscape, and then I put black-and-white photos of tigers in cages, you know like just getting bored. And I think yes, we did another one, but it was some, how do you call that? Not silk-screen but, you know, when you spray the painting.\nMT: Like stencil? [11:55]\nMS: Yes, stencils. And the background was covered with dead leaves, and it was red and black. And then I put the photo that we did under the bridge where he is like beat up. And I put a kind of a grillage in front of it. And this is one of the paintings, too. I have photos of that. I have photos.\nGW: Did you work on collages together? Or is that what you’re describing, where there’s paintings and\nMS: No, I’m describing that he would paint and I would bring a photo. And then we would see how this would fit in the painting, and he would cut out a window so I could put the photo behind. This was, I mean, we worked together because we spoke a lot, but at the same time, he would paint and I would say, “Okay, what do you think about this photo?” So this was the collaboration show we had.\nGW: What about films?\nMS: So film, again, it’s like I brought, I mean, he trusted me with video. The first time he asked me, he knew that I was making videos, because I was a photographer and I also liked to make videos, documentaries and sometimes like more personal videos. So the first time he asked me, he was doing this film with Rosa von Praunheim. And he called me in Paris and he said, “You know, I’d love you to be here in New York while I’m doing this film. I’m not very sure of myself, and you will help me to __[13:49] the film.” And he said, “Can you come with a video camera? So maybe we’ll do something together.” And so I rented a camera in Paris, and I came with a camera. And we talked – first it was my idea. I said, “We should maybe try to make a movie about you. Not a documentary, but something” – with David it’s never a documentary. It’s creative. So, he was excited by the idea, but at the same time he had mixed feelings about that, how he would represent himself at this stage of his life. He had just learned that he was HIV positive. So, you know, in fact, that’s what I say, it’s like, I could bring things to support his work. But in fact, almost everything we did was his idea. But you know like, for example, I say it in the book with Sylvère, in the interview. For example, the strongest example for me is that he shot, Rosa von Praunheim shot this – David wanted to have images of him kissing a man’s body. And I knew that he was attracted to Paul Smith, so I said, “You know, maybe you can imagine something with Paul Smith.” So he was excited by that, and he said, “But maybe Paul wouldn’t like it.” Also, I was close to Paul, we used to go on bicycles together and take photos around. And so I asked Paul and right away he said yes. So they started shooting for Rosa von Praunheim with a camera-person of Rosa, they started shooting something about David kissing a man. And then David took me to see the rushes. And in fact, we were kind of disappointed, because, I don’t know what went on because I’m not gay, but I don’t know if it was because the guy who shot it wasn’t gay or couldn’t understand really what could be between two men. I don’t know, but it was not really sensuous. It was more like wide angles, or, you know. And for me, maybe as a woman, I don’t know, or because I was close to David, for me, sensuality, it’s more like close-ups and follow, you know, a close-up on the mouth, a close-up on the bodies. So I imagined it differently. And so we were disappointed, and I said to David, “Let’s try to do it again, in your loft.” And we asked Paul if he wants to do it again. So Paul said okay. And we were there in the loft with Paul, David, and Andreas Sterzing. And we started shooting. So David knew what he wanted, but my eye kept the images. I filmed very in slow motion, like David kissing Paul’s body. And then they start – of course, the idea of Paul kissing David, and Andreas Sterzing putting water with strobe light; this is David images.\nMT: Absolutely; yeah.\nMS: So this was the kind of collaboration. And I say also, in the interview with Sylvère, it’s like that’s where I realized what could be my work in video with David. Like I was an extension of his eyes. Like, through my eyes, I was an extension of his mind somewhere. That I could make images the way – listening to him, I knew what kind of images I could do.\nGW: So this was When I Put My Hands on Your Body?\nMS: Yes.\nGW: And then there was Under Water.\nMS: Well, Under Water the same. If you read the interview with Sylvère, we went upstate New York. We rented a house, Sylvère’s house. I went there with my boyfriend, François __[18:45] and who edited all of the videos we did with David. And one morning, David was really depressed, and he had all of these horrible dreams, nightmares. And he talked for more than an hour about that all of this was meaningful, and all of this rage he had, confronting what he was going through. And I was desperate, because there was nothing I could do about it, just listen to him. And then I said to him, “Let’s go to the lake.” Because we used to go to the lake and film on the boat. And I said, “Let’s go to the lake and I can take images of you swimming, rowing, and then you can put a text on it. And it could serve the movie we want to do. It could help. Then I’ll make a clone so you can put a text on it, your voice over it, and speak about your tension and also that you feel like suffocating.” So we did that. We took the boat and we went on the lake, and I filmed him swimming, rowing. And then at a point, we had fun. I mean, if you listen to the sound, sometime we had fun. And I said to him, “Just go under the water to see what it does.” And then I saw these images of his face and his body completely distorted by the water. And then I said, “Look; this is great;” and I kept on doing these images. And he loved it, he really loved it. And so, you know, I helped him, like, I thought: Okay, I’m doing these images. They will help him to express something about his despair. And I did it, and, you know, he could make a piece; we could make a piece. But it would be his text. So that was the exchange we had.\nGW: Do you know much about how he worked with other people?\nMS: He loved to work with other people. No, I can’t say, because the only thing I saw is, you know that photograph that Andreas did of him, you know the portrait with the nest and the globe?\nGW: Yes; right.\nMS: Again, this was David’s concept. And Andreas technically did it very well, because it’s not a collage, it’s really on the same film. Like you would mask half of the negative to be able to have just one, and then he would do a mask on what he just shot, to shut something out. It was technically very well done. Not with other people, no, I don’t know. I wasn’t there.\nGW: I guess I’m just curious. The way you describe working with him, you said it was often very much his idea, and you worked with him to facilitate it but you obviously brought your own creative vision to it. Do you think he mainly worked like that with other people? Was it almost always his idea, or were there people that he would sort of allow other people to take the lead?\nMS: I can’t say. Really. I wasn’t there, so I can’t say.\n: Sure.\nMS: I mean for me, there was no power trip when we were working together. I was anyway, so en extase. You say that, you know, about David, and his work and his concept, and you know the way, the political way also of making art. So there was no power trip. I trusted him completely, and I think he trusted me a lot. We could exchange; it was really an exchange. Like, for example, when, that was the most exciting moment for me, when he prepared the first show at PPOW. I came three weeks before the show. He already sent me some photos. He was working in the darkroom, and he sent me some photos of the Sex series, like saying: You know, this is what I’m trying; I’m experimenting; what do you think about it? And I thought it was amazing, so I supported him. I said, “Great.” And then he said, “Why don’t you come? I need you. I have a lot of ideas.” So I came and I spent three weeks. And he had these ideas of photo pieces, so we went through the contact sheets, you know, like, looking what would match together and what he could say about a piece. Like, there was The Weight of the Earth. There was the things about through economics, with the three. There was the baby, his niece, like a little baby. And then a photo of a soldier in front of a bush. And there were these three photos of the hands with money, the sewed lips, and a newspaper with money. And I think the newspaper was something from Wall Street, all the values. So we worked on that. I remember that we tried a lot of prints. He did all these prints in the darkroom, and we would put them on the floor and see how things would work together. Then he would think about it and conceive the piece. And I remember for the mats, he would measure everything very precisely and he would ask a professional person to cut the mats. But usually you give the photos and they put the mats on the photos. No, he would make the mats be cut, and then he would put the photos. I don’t know why, but he wanted things like very, very precisely.\nGW: It sounds like he was very methodical. [25:40]\nMS: Yes.\nGW: Did he actually think things through in advance?\nMS: I’m sure he had, in advance. You can see, for example, the video I shot when we were in upstate New York, this little bird.\nMT: I love that moment. Yes.\nMS: I’m sure he thought already about this text. It’s improvisation but he had already the idea of the text. I’m sure of that.\nMT: That’s really important, because he stops at some moment, and then he starts it again, and that’s where you can see that yes, he had thought this – it looks like it’s totally improvisatory but it’s not. It’s really planned.\nMS: The same with the little house, you know, this little house where people are living. It’s a little house, a cardboard house in the garden. And he shot it. And I think it’s something that he really conceived. But for example, there’s no editing in this piece. He did it all from the beginning to the end, with the voiceover. And you can hear the tap of the – because you know with this camera, there was a lot of effects possible. So you could shoot frame by frame by just pushing the button, and you can hear the sound of the button. But at the same time, that same summer, I don’t know if you saw in the rushes when he spoke to the cat and told the story; this is improvisation, completely. There was a book like this about animals, an old book, and there was this ugly cat but very, like, we liked, this ugly cat that came on his lap. And then he took the book and he is looking at the tigers and the leopard, and he said, “You see, this is your mom and this is your dad, and this is your crazy uncle, the drunk one. And this one, oh, he’s in the psychiatric hospital upstate,” you know, something like that. This was really improvisation. It was not something that he set.\nGW: Sometimes he planned things out and maybe other times he didn’t but it’s improvised.\nMS: Yes. [27:50]\nGW: I’m always interested in the relationship between an idea in an artist’s mind and then what happens in the creative process to that idea, and the end result. And I think different artists work in very different ways.\nMS: You see, I can show you something because it’s a part of the project I have here. Of course, I’m not going to do it like if we did it, but let me show you a storyboard that he left me. Because upstate New York, Andreas Sterzing went for a few days and he had this SVHS camera. And we worked with it and we loved it. At the beginning, it was more like vacation shooting, like laughing and being in the garden and stuff like that. And then I asked Andreas if he could leave us the camera because we were excited by that. We thought that we could do a lot of things that summer. It was not the purpose of going for the summer, because he was working on Close to the Knives. That’s why he took all of his diaries with him and all, you know. So it was more for him to work on the book. But then with the camera, something happened; we were excited by that. And then my friend François was with us. He said to David, he said, because we would look at what we shot every night on the TV set. And some few things were really beautiful, like the shooting underwater, and even David filming me rowing, and the story with the cat. So François said to him, “But you know, you should make videos the way you make your paintings. It means that you have a background, from a painting, and in your paintings you have cut out where you put photos or drawings or, you know. So what you should do is, instead of putting still images, you could insert moving images.” And François is a really good editor and a great filmmaker, video filmmaker. So he said to David, “You know, you could work video like that, and make images, moving images and still images.” So David loved the idea, and he said, oh, we should try to do something. And he said, “I’m going to draw you a storyboard, and then you take it to Paris and you see what you can do with it. And if you can find money to produce it, and we’ll try to do something.” So he left this.\nGW: What is it?\nMS: It’s a storyboard; you can look at it. It’s a short text that David wrote on the project. Maybe if you want to read it.\nGW: I could read it. It’s a paragraph. It says, “Video 5 to 6 minutes. This video will be a visual opera with spoken words exploring birth and death. It will examine in images the structures of nature and society. The icons of society in the forms of sex, money, death, religion and time. Ants will be used as a metaphor for human civilization, because ants create wars, have slaves, have monarchy systems, etc. All this will be viewed through the eyes of someone who is a social outcast, someone outside the accepted structure of society, a man who is homosexual and who has AIDS. David Wojnarowicz, 1989.”\nMS: So this was the summer. And here you have like – so we spoke about that and we decided to start with two paintings, this one, Something from Sleep and another one, Fear of Evolution, I think. So, from here, he drew the painting. And then he put, “Here you will put black. And here, on the second image, this becomes red, and this guy sleeping will be the Super 8 I shot of Peter dead.”\nGW: So these are just real quick sketches of paintings that he planned to make.\nMS: Not paintings; videos. [32:50]\nGW: I’m sorry, videos; yes.\nMS: Videos, because, for example, this is a still, this is the painting, but then it becomes moving here, because this becomes Peter Hujar and it’s Super 8 shooting. So the painting, I mean the frame, the image, starts moving. And then the next is this, and then he said: We will put real ants __[33:15] because here it’s more like, you know, it’s a drawing. So here we will put this with ants. And here there’s four moons, so these are photos. So he said everything.\nMT: This is the rabid dog photo, right?\nMS: Uh, which one is dog photo? I think it’s the one of the\nMT: From Fever?\nMS: Yes.\nMT: Yes, exactly. Right, I love, that installation.\n\\MS: I have these prints.\nMT: You do? That’s one of my favorite of all of his works. It just tears me apart. It’s beautiful.\nMS: I really love it.\nGW: These sketches are extraordinary, because they really do illustrate just how he worked.\nMS: And you know, some of the shooting, it’s things that I did like, for example, this is in video, when we did When I Put my Hands on Your Body. It’s not in the final cut but I have the rushes. This is David undressing Paul. Some of the images are David’s images, footage, and some others are mine. Like here is the Christ. So he left, so you see, he conceived it. So of course, maybe if we would have had time to do it together, it would have changed things. You always change things because you have a concept but then something doesn’t work, so you put another image or you,\nGW: But these sketches are really well thought out. He definitely\nMS: Yes, that’s why I say, he knew what he wanted, from the beginning to the end.\nGW: Fascinating.\nMS: He did an experiment. [34:48]\nMT: Here’s the Christ with the ants, which of course, was that footage – here again, we’re talking footage that he had that he reuses in different times, and it signifies differently in different contexts.\nMS: Like a sentence. You build up a sentence. He built up a vocabulary of images, and then with that, he would put them in different ways and it would be a new sentence.\nMT: Yes, exactly. Because he talks about\nMS: That’s what I loved in his work. And I like the fact that images are used and they’re reused always in another context; you know?\n: Yes. Absolutely. These are beautiful. How wonderful.\nMS: So what we want to do, and that’s for this, that I came here at Fales, because what we want to do with François is to show the process of David’s work.\nGW: This is your current project. Could you just very quickly describe your current project?\nMS: The current project is the one I told you about, about the interview. But this will be a little bit an interview, but I want to make it also like to be just one piece. And what we want to do is to enter in David’s mind, concept and creation. So what we will do is, we start with this, and then each frame on the video, on the film, we’ll take, for example, this one, and we’ll put what he said. For example, one after the other, here is the black, we will have the painting, and then we will have this black. And then we go to the next. But we will start always from the drawing, always from the sketch.\nGW: Just to back up,\nMS: We’re not going to make it like he did it. We’re going to show his process of work. That’s what I would like to do.\nGW: So you’re creating a film based on interviews, or based on an interview. Could you just say that again? You described it before we started this interview.\nMS: Yes; okay. So this is – I videotaped – this is also something that I suggest. Because David was always complaining that intellectuals didn’t care about his work, that he was not intellectual enough for certain people. He was always saying that people don’t care, and he’d be, because he didn’t have the intellectual background. He was an intellectual, of course, thinking things. And he was reading also, maybe not books but at least the ideas that were in the books. And I was a very close friend of Sylvère Lotringer’s since the 1970s, and he always supported me in New York and even in my relationship with David. And also he rented the house to us. You know? I mean, he was very supportive. And I said to him – and he spoke about semiotypes or something like that, and I said, “Would you like Sylvère to interview you?” So he was like, “Oh, he won’t give a shit about that.” And I said, “Okay, let’s try.” And I asked Sylvère, and Sylvère of course said yes, of course. And he loved David’s work. And Sylvère is always curious about the artist and creation. So we set that interview. And again, that’s the way I would support him, you know, like trying to put my connections together to get him what he would like. [38:25]\nGW: So your plan is to use the footage of that interview as a basis for a film that you’re now making.\nMS: Yes. The interview will be a guideline. Like I said, the title of the film will be “Self-Portrait in 23 Rounds” which is the title of a chapter of David’s book. And a chapter in David Wojnarowicz’s life, 1989 -1991. And so we’re going to take the structure of the 23 Rounds; in fact, it’s going to be 23 chapters, talking. So we won’t need to be in a chronological aspect of the interview. But we’ll create chapters, and in the chapters we will let David speak about his work, about a lot of things, his anxiousness, his confrontation with death, and what he had at this moment in mind. But we will have also chapters that will be about creation, about David’s work, a documentary about David at this moment of his life. But also because he created a lot during these years. For me, it was one of the most prolific – which is not true, because when I see everything he has done, you know. But at that moment I shared with him, it was so creative. So I’m going to do that. So this will be a part of it. [40:10]\nGW: Yeah, well, I can’t wait to see that film!\nMT: Yeah; it’s amazing.\nMS: So I don’t know if we’re going to be able to put it entirely in the interview, but it will be a piece by itself, which will be a four or five minute video.\nGW: The sketches are fantastic. People will be really interested in seeing them.\nMS: I think it’s a good way to get into David’s mind. The question you were asking about how creates, how he comes from an idea to the production of this idea, I think this will be a\nGW: These sketches really speak to that.\nMS: And it’s an ambitious project, you know. I mean, I’m looking for $30,000 to do that, and $30,000 is not that much. But we need good equipment and also to pay the rights for the images, because, I guess, they are David’s images, so I will have to see with Tom and through you. And also technically we need, because we’re going to need also a sound engineer.\nGW: Could we switch gears a little bit? I’d like to discuss exhibitions. Because part of this resource we’re building will be for curators in the future who may want to exhibit his work. And so I think it’s important for them to understand how David exhibited his own work and other people’s work. Could you talk a little bit about the process or maybe even what you know of his vision for allowing other people to see his work?\nMS: What do you mean?\nGW: Can you describe it a little bit better, Marvin? I’m trying to put myself in the seat of a curator who really is trying to understand how David would want his work to be exhibited, or how he even did exhibit it. [42:22]\nMS: I know that in his diary about his first show at PPOW, I saw a note about the show. But you can see that it’s not really what, for example, he took photos of me in a swamp, covered with mud. And in the notes he said that he wanted to use it and also use the abandoned car with the globe and with another photo, and he didn’t use them. But he wrote about it. Maybe looking more closely to his diaries of 1988 and 1989, you could find other notes. When I will be in Paris – I started already looking at every page, and it’s unbelievable. It’s really great stuff. And me, I’m looking more, of course I looked at in the ’77 in Paris, et cetera, but I looked more ’88, ’89, and until ’91. And I’m sure I’m, going to find things. But there’s already a page that I took a screen shot of it. I can show it to you.\nMT: One question I have is, were you involved in any of the installations that he did? The installation pieces?\nMS: The one in, do you know these photos I did? It’s an empty lot on the Lower East Side, and he has – it’s on my computer, on my first page of computer, but I can send you the photos. It’s an installation on the lower East Side, and you have the baby elephant, you have the mannequin on fire, you have skulls, and fire in a garbage can. And I have two photos – I mean, we kept two photos of that. One he’s waiting. You know, he has a machine gun. He’s waiting like that on top of a little hill. And the second one, he’s shouting, like jumping, the beginning of jumping and shouting, screaming. This, yes, we worked together on that. But on the other ones, no. I don’tremember.\nMT: One thing we’re thinking a lot about is how did he go about the installations, and how did he choose objects, how did he place them. Because no one’s really done much research on it. And we have slides of a lot of installations, but there’s no complete list, for instance, of the installations.\nMS: I think, you know, he worked the same that I shared with him. It’s like he had already the idea in mind. He knew what he wanted to say and had already the idea in mind.\nMT: I know I’ve seen drawings in the collection where he, especially in the phone logs, he would sit there and talk on the phone and draw. And I’ve seen a lot of installation plans that are worked on in the phone logs, which I found really fascinating.\nMS: That’s strange.\nMT: Yeah.\nMS: But you mean that he was talking to other people?\nMT: Mm-hm.\nMS: Saying what he would do?\nMT: Well, I don’t know if that’s what it was, or if he was just talking to other people but sitting there and drawing while he was talking to them. Because the phone logs are actually filled with drawings as well.\nMS: What do you mean? The phone logs are the tapes, right?\nMT: No, no.\nMS: What is phone log?\nMT: He kept, and in fact, I do it now because he did it. I keep a notebook with everybody who calls me. And what David\nMS: Oh, okay; this is a phone log.\nMT: Yes. David kept these.\nMS: Okay, I thought it was the tapes of the answering machine.\nMT: Those are interesting too, but he kept these logs of everybody who called him, and he wrote\nMS: And the calendar.\nMT: And the calendars.\nMS: Because he would write, I remember when I shot his table, the calendar, he would put on every day everything he had to do. Yes, that’s great; that’s great you have that.\nMT: He’s meticulous about documenting himself all the time. It’s really fascinating. And the phone log tapes are really amazing. There are also audio diaries where he taped diary entries.\nMS: Before I leave, I’d like to listen to some of them __.[47:00]\nGW: You know, getting back to my question, maybe I can articulate it a little bit better. I worry that in the future, people won’t understand the ethos of downtown New York in this period. It really was not a museum scene. It wasn’t even, it became, a gallery scene, but a lot of it was on the street, was in warehouses, on the piers.\nMS: The pier was the beginning, really, of this artist crowd.\nGW: Yes. So I worry that exhibitions in white-cube galleries and museums in the future won’t communicate what was going on. And I think the longer we are from that period time-wise, the more difficult it will be for people to understand it and try to convey it in exhibitions. I think that was the root of my question.\nMS: Yes. But you know, I mean, those photos, if they want to reset the installations, they have to do it the way it is. They can’t interpret it; no? I mean, they have to follow what is on the slides.\nGW: Well, of course, it’s always a curatorial question, how much authorship can a curator bring to an interpretation of an artist’s work.\nMS: Yes but not in an installation. I mean, a curator won’t paint things on a painting.\nGW: Right. [48:35]\nMS: He can choose the painting. He can put it in relation with something else. That’s his creative work. But he is not going to paint on the painting. And I think, I mean for me, an installation has to be the way it was. And you know you could ask PPOW because I think they want to show the installation that was done uptown to great collectors like rich people who asked David to make an installation in their apartment.\nGW: Well we will definitely interview people at PPOW. Can you think of anyone else that we should interview?\nMS: Lots of people. Lots of people.\nGW: Who comes to mind?\nMS: In terms of collaboration?\nGW: Yes, people that worked with him or that would know him and that would be able to tell us things about his working methods or his exhibitions.\nMS: I mean, the ones I know in films are Tommy Turner. I don’t like too much the film they did together. I don’t know, I didn’t like it. It’s not really David. I mean, it was, but, I don’t know. Anyway, but Tommy Turner for sure, he traveled with him and they made movies together. __[50:00] as movie makers. In terms of artists, I was thinking about, oh, I forgot his name. He traveled with him, too, and they collaborated on certain things.\nMT: James Romberger?\nMS: Well, James, of course.\nMT: James and Marguerite.\nMS: Yes. I was thinking about this artist; I took him and his work – well, the name will come.\nGW: Anyone in Paris that we might not think of or know about?\nMS: No, in Paris no. I know his lover, Jean-Pierre, but he wasn’t an artist at all. You might ask Kiki Smith if she still wants to speak about that.\nGW: And Jean-Pierre wouldn’t be so helpful for the kinds of questions we’re asking?\nMS: Maybe, because he posed – when you look at the contact sheets, he posed for Rimbaud. I think Rimbaud started in Paris.\nGW: Interesting.\nMT: With the photos David did of the Eiffel Tower, et cetera.\nMS: Yes. No, they started in Paris. And you know, there’s this French artist, and I’m sure that David got the idea from him, Ernest Pignon, at this moment in 1977. I know because I loved this work, I loved this guy. And he had this set of posters of Rimbaud in Paris, and he would put them in corners, and it was fantastic. And I’m sure David got the idea from that.\nGW: Can you think of anything else that we haven’t brought up?\nMS: I mean, Jean-Pierre might have some work also, early work of David. As a collaborator, well, some are not there any more.\nGW: Is there anything else that you think that people should know about David and his work and his – when people are thinking about exhibiting or interpreting his work in the future. [52:35]\nMS: I don’t know. That’s a hard question. Maybe I’ll think about it and I’ll send it by mail to you. What should they know? They should know that they should try not to betray David’s mind and feelings in terms of art and in terms of politics. David was a very political artist. You know, it’s like sometimes I think about this like that. It’s like, when you see Josef Beuys, what they show now in galleries, it’s all clean, it’s all the conceptual work. And all of the political years are completely erased. And you know, I wonder if one day it’s not going to happen the same thing with David.\nGW: This is getting to my question. That his work was his life, and became very political, and of course with AIDS activism, and\nMS: Even before.\nGW: Yes, it was always political.\nMS: The way he would view society and the United States, like x-rays. He was very political even before the AIDS crisis.\nGW: And I worry that will be lost in the white cube.\nMT: Yes.\nMS: What do you call “the white cube”?\nGW: Oh, just a museum with white walls, a very sterile environment.\nMS: Ah; okay.\nMT: There’s something I’ve been wanting to ask for quite a while, and I hope it doesn’t go over into interpretation. I want to really keep it to The Fire in My Belly. But because you’re working on 1989-1991, it strikes me that David was working on A Fire in My Belly because he was concerned about the individual in culture. And that was what the original film was going to be about. And what happened with his diagnosis is that he changed his mind about what Fire in My Belly was going to be. And that’s when he took out the sections that he took out that ended up in Silence=Death with Rosa. And his work shifted from that politics about the individual in society\nMS: You’re right.\nMT: To the politics of someone with AIDS in society.\nMS: And I think for me, that’s why the piece for Rosa is stronger. It’s something like, each time I see it, it’s very strong. The editing is strong, the content is strong.\nMT: He sort of knew that Fire in My Belly was not going anywhere at that point, it seems, and so that’s why he put his energies with the strongest parts of Fire in My Belly, which ended up in Silence=Death. That seems to me; a hunch, but.\nMS: Now, you know, about the music, I can’t be – now things are mixed up in my mind. It’s possible, knowing Rosa, and Rosa being German, I think maybe he put the music of Diamanda; maybe it’s him. But at the same time, with François, when we look at Fire in My Belly, the editing is so close to the music that – you know, François is an editor, and he knows, he can say: This has been done with the music. Now my question is, how come that this piece of music is not in David’s files? That’s my question. Because I saw, since you wrote this text on __’s [56:25] book, because I read it and I think it was really interesting to see the work you did, et cetera. I’m sure the editing is David; I’m convinced; I’m convinced. I know David; I know his way of editing; I know, you know, it’s him. Now the music, now I have a doubt. I have a doubt. It could be Rosa, this, because in Diamanda there is also this kind of German, you know.\nMT: Mm-hm; very, very much.\nMS: But David never complained about it; never. I know David, and he always complained about everything and everybody. And if it was Rosa who had edited Fire in My Belly, I don’t think he would have accepted it. This I’m sure of that. Because, you know, his work was his work. Now, maybe, you know, he gave everything silent, and then I mixed up and I thought there was music with it. This, I’m not sure, you know. I’m not sure of that. When I read your article, then I had a doubt. Maybe the music came after; this is possible. But David liked it, that’s for sure. Because David saw the tape; he saw the final cut of the film. And so I never heard him, like, saying, “He stole my work.” You know?\nMT: That’s really helpful.\nGW: Yes, I’m glad we got to that.\nMT: Yeah.\nGW: Can you think of anything else that you’d like to say?\nMS: If you want, we can stop here. But if I have ideas of something, then I will send it by mail to you.\nMT: Please. Yes. That would be wonderful.\nMS: Okay.\nMT: Thank you so much, Marion.\nGW: Thank you so much for your time.\nMS: You’re welcome.\nEND at 58:33\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_Text_with_David_Kiehl_by_Diana_Kamin_and_Marvin_Taylor_on_8-10-2016&oldid=4304\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterview Text\nThis page was last modified on 12 May 2017, at 09:27.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

So, you were saying you were going to tell us about your interaction with David. My first question was going to be, how did you first learn about his work and where did you encounter it?\nRR: So it was certainly through PPOW. I was at the School of Visual Arts finishing my degree and I was working for an artist, Lorraine O’Grady, who would take me to galleries. And through that, I think the first installation I saw, which was an anonymous installation that he did with Paul Marcus and a few other people at PPOW, it was on Broadway in Soho. I think, I don’t know if they called it the Lazarus Ship. It’s easily found out.\nDK: The Lazaretto?\nRR: The Lazaretto. So that was my – I should have done my own archival research before getting here. So I saw that piece, and that piece was just bone chilling. It was just such an experience. I don’t think I had ever seen a gallery transformed quite that extensively. You entered the space. It was like black garbage bags that were lining the walls, with writing and all kinds of things. And then you entered into a room, what looked to be like what we would call a tenement room. And there was a presence, a person who was obviously not real, skeletal, in very bad shape, and then lots of medication and different things all over the place. So you went through the installation and that ended up with the ship, a space that was like a ship, and then there were all of these sculpture arms coming out from all of the walls. And through the entire installation you could hear Louis Armstrong’s It’s a Wonderful World. And just this haunting – every time I hear that song, I can never divorce it from that installation. I didn’t know, I don’t think I knew David’s work so consciously at that point. But that was just resonant.\nDK: And so this would have been before you were working at PPOW?\nRR: That was before I worked at the gallery. And so eventually, I ended up working for Lorraine, who I then met Gracie Mansion through Kathy Goncharov. All of these people connect. Kathy Goncharov was a curator at the New School’s collection. Kathy connected me to Gracie and Fred Wilson. And so I did some work for Fred when he did a show at Gracie’s. Gracie was the floor above PPOW, and I met Wendy and Penny, and they needed a preparator, so I ended up working there. And that was, from what I can piece together, that was 1991. So it probably was winter or spring, 1991. So it was the year before David’s death. And so, the gallery, because I was a preparator, I was the one that got to see everybody’s work very intimately, not only doing installations but I was in charge of the storage in the back room. And Wendy was also very generous. We would often have conversations about the artists, we’d have conversations about work. We would talk about, well what are we going to put up in the Projects space when a new show came up. And I had taken a real deep interest in David’s work that just continued to evolve. Many works that are now at like MoMA and stuff, I would pull them out and I would just sit and look at them. So it was this incredible time that I don’t even think I realized how amazing that was to be able to do. So. I don’t know if you want me to keep going on the whole story, or?\nDK: Sure, yeah, go ahead.\nRR: So I was working at the gallery, very interested in David along with other artists that were there. And of course everyone was very concerned about David’s health. He had works that he wanted to complete. He had more photo works that he wanted to complete. That included the large black-and-whites with the red silkscreen text, or screen text, over it, When I Lay My Hands on You [Global query: When I Put My Hands on Your Body?] and then Spiral, which was the last work he produced. There were others. And so, I think there’s multiple reasons; I mean, Penny and Wendy just wanted to help him. And I had done a photo degree at SVA. I was young, gay, cuter than I am now, [laughing] and I thought they thought well maybe if David would feel comfortable, because he was very private, that I could help him. And it’s funny, I didn’t remember until actually riding on the train, though they had begun talking to David about this, and David at that point was rarely coming into the gallery, although did come in to do some signing or something, and we met. And then, I don’t know how it happened but obviously Penny or Wendy said, ‘Robert will help you, anything you need. If you want to get back into the darkroom, maybe he can do some prints; whatever.’ And I do remember David actually called me on my home phone. And I’m sure you’ve listened to David’s voice in recordings, and it’s a very powerful voice. And I think I still have the tape somewhere.\nDK: Oh, wow.\nRR: But I recently moved and I don’t know where exactly. But it’s like, ‘Robert, this is David Wojnarowicz,’ and it’s an incredibly deep voice. So that was an amazing, for me, again, resonant. I don’t remember, I’m pretty sure Close to the Knives came out, and I of course read it. And I on some level, in retrospect, have wished I hadn’t read it before I started having more interactions with him, because it was such a weight. Because that is a heady book for anyone to read, and reading it when I was like 23 years old, and as a kid who grew up with AIDS always in my landscape as an adult, it was just so intimidating. So the process happened that Penny and Wendy then started using me to deliver to David. And I don’t know what all they’ve said about my role, and I don’t think it’s even in public record, but I was basically couriering cash to David every week or every other week, so that he could pay for his service providers. So I would walk from the corner of Spring Street and Broadway with like a pocketful of $5,000 of cash to the East Village to David’s place above the theater. And then we would almost always sit and talk. Like, he only would have visitors if I think he was feeling semi-okay. Although he certainly would talk about – although he never made it an issue, I could tell when he was tired. Another thing I was thinking of as I was coming here, I don’t ever remember, except for once, anyone else being there. Which was also surprising to me because I know that there were many friends and people helping caretake. I know on one occasion definitely there were some other folks there, but for the most part, I would just come, and it would – I wish I had brought my camera. I mean, there are so many things I wish I had done. But we would sit there, and at the time I also smoked, and David loved to smoke, I think.\nDK: Yes.\nRR: And I remember, I mean, I’m sure there are photographs of the loft, it was a classic kind of artist’s space as I imagined New York artists to have. Reminiscent of the old Soho lofts, but this was so unusual because it was integrated into this theater building. So it was very strange. And then the arced windows. But, you know, it was semi-disheveled. He had a bed, certainly, by the window, but where I encountered him most was at the kitchen table, which was in the corner in the little kitchen with the windows looking out over the avenue. And we would sit and smoke for a little while. So we’d just sort of hang out, and he would ask what I was doing. And again, it just like, talking to him I felt so intimidated, but he was really at ease and very, very generous. I had no idea, one, how close to death he was. And our whole hope was that, because there were moments that I think he was rebounding or getting stronger, and then it would just be like this kind of thing through the time that I was working at PPOW. So it was never a, ‘This is over.’ It was always a, ‘When will you be well enough,’ and ‘When will you want to go back in the darkroom?’ I know there was a darkroom in the back part of the space. I have a little memory of just him maybe opening the door, but he certainly was not in any condition to make anything, at least in the darkroom. And so sadly, we never actually did anything physical there. Certainly at the time I also had become friends with Gary Schneider and John, who were doing his large prints, and I was helping bring proofs and things like that to the loft. And then we would just sit at the table. But again, not long in-depth dialogues about the work. He didn’t, and I never asked; he wasn’t really talking about process or what he was working on. It was very much, like I was kind of like just this weird alien that would arrive, and I think it was just sort of this reprieve from what he was dealing with, which was just insanity, you know, like being so, so sick. But he never did that – he was much more interested in me. So I think in the spirit of David, it probably, that’s the resonance of this unknown young person who was an artist, trying to become an artist, and his interest in that and what I was doing. So it was very much more about me than it ever was about him. He would get the cash and then he would want to know what I’m doing. There were a couple of moments that were sort of funny. This was also the time when U-2 got interested in David. And I remember, it was a Sunday, they went to the gallery and the gallery opened for Bono and the crew to come in and look at David’s work, which I know they ended up buying a number of pieces, and then they used the buffaloes on the cover of the one CD. And I remember he was just, he was so funny because they wanted him to come to their concert. And he was very sick at the time, but he went. And so he was telling me the story, and he’s like, ‘Yeah, Bono wanted me to go down and pray with the band before the concert.’ [laughter] And I’m like [silence]. And he’s like, ‘Of course I didn’t go pray with Bono and the band before the concert! I would never!’ [laughter] And of course he would never. [laughing] He hated the Catholic Church. He didn’t want anything to do with the religion of Catholicism. So no, he did not go. That must have been later because I think the concert was in Jersey at the Meadowlands, and they had another show at Yankee Stadium, and I did go. And by that time David was dead. And I remember his name going across the screen and it had the death date, and it was like the birth date and the death date, it was just like, just really intense. But I think David, and now I’m adding my own point of view, but I think David definitely liked the attention. There was a thrill about it. And he certainly wanted, I think to, by any means necessary, get his ideas into the world, as representative of the many different things he did. And so I think he kind of, he loved it, even though he was subversive about it.\nDK: Yeah.\nRR: And I think, and I can’t remember, I was trying to find information, but I think Boy George did something with his work at that time, too. It might be interesting to look. Because he thought that was hilarious, too. And he actually, I can remember him with somebody who was there, it was either a friend or an attendant or something, and they opened up some album cover or something to show me, because he thought it was really funny. And these happened very close to each other. So it was like this interesting irony that popular culture suddenly was using his images and were interested in him as representative of the AIDS struggle. And I think he got a very big kick out of it because it was the most animated and funny I witnessed him through the, I don’t know, ten months, year, that I was at all interacting with him.\nDK: So maybe just to set the scene a little more, was there clutter on the kitchen table? Was it a spare kitchen table? The space where you guys would spend time at.\nRR: I remember it being white, kind of old school, like a ‘50s kind of table. I think there were teacups there, and also it was sort of open shelves, so you could kind of see everything. It was clear somebody was – I mean, the place was classic artist’s loft, although probably when there was no one coming in to help him it was much more disheveled or messy. So it felt neat-ish, but not necessarily how it would have been? I don’t know. Because it was such an artificial time because people I know were – he had so many loving friends who would go. So my guess is that they would keep everything pretty clean. So yes, there was stuff on the table, newspapers, as I recall, things like reading materials and teacups. I remember teacups. And I might have that wrong, but that’s kind of how I imagine it. And an ashtray, for sure, with lots of cigarettes.\nDK: Any sort of unusual items around the apartment? Some people have talked about the skeleton of a baby elephant.\nRR: [laughs] The skeleton of a baby elephant, I kind of rem -- Honestly, my visuals of the apartment, like, I can see the arcing windows, and I know the door was like here, and then the kitchen was over here, so I would have to go across this big – I can’t remember exactly where the bed was placed, because as I recall, it moved. So I guess as he got sicker, they would shift it. I wish I had spent more time examining the things. Again, it was like I was very self-conscious. So everything is sort of clouded with the glowing person of, like, admiration versus ‘Oh, what an interesting sculpture you have there.’ I think the globe was there, the black globe that he had made a piece, a sculpture out of. And also, because I spent right before that time working with Fred Wilson whose loft I spent a lot of time in, I’ve kind of merged the two a little bit. And so I don’t remember a lot of details. There was definitely a lot of stuff in the space, but not that I __.\nDK: Your sense is he wasn’t working at that time.\nRR: Well, David’s working took on many forms. My guess is he was writing. I’m certain he was conceiving. I know that there were more photos, I believe, in the __[17:15] series that included Spiral and When I Lay My Hands on You [sic], that were never completed.\nDK: Yeah, I’ve seen two accounts, one is that he had planned five, and one is that he had planned three.\nRR: Penny or Wendy would be a better judge, or Gary and John certainly knew. If there was anything that was on its way to going, they would know. Because he, I think, talked to them a lot about stuff, and they would have done anything for him. So.\nDK: And the times when you would bring over proofs, you said there wasn’t really a lot of discussion; he would just sort of sign off on them? Or were there ever times __\nRR: I remember once, and I think it actually was for Spiral. I brought it and I remember opening it, but he wasn’t feeling well. So I didn’t get an answer, I didn’t get anything. It was just like, ‘I’ll let Penny and Wendy know.’ So again, unfortunately there wasn’t much dialogue. So, in that time, he wasn’t well. I think he thought he probably could. There was somebody there at that point, and they were just, like, ‘Just leave it and he’ll look at it later.’ Unfortunately, I have no real insights into that.\nDK: That’s all right. It’s great to hear this other sort of, especially from this time in his life and meeting someone new. So what kinds of questions would he ask you about your work or your life?\nRR: Basic, like, ‘What are you making?’ He asked me where I was from, and being from the Midwest, again, I can’t recall all of the particulars, but he was interested in that. I think he was interested in anybody who kind of grew up in a place that wasn’t necessarily hospitable to if you were gay or different or anything of that nature. Knowing his love of the Southwest, I wish I knew him now, because I’ve spent twenty years going out. But the questions were really, they were just simple. I think again, at this point in his life, there wasn’t necessarily a lot of energy for plowing deeply in with somebody new. I think he was just, he was trying to become familiar. It was funny because part of it was me helping him feel comfortable with me, so that I could potentially help him with any work that he wanted to do. And in fact, like I said earlier, the reverse. He was on some level helping me feel comfortable. So it was just small talk. There wasn’t a whole lot of other stuff, except for when he would retell these other stories that he just thought were funny.\nDK: That were sort of contemporary stories.\nRR: Yes. Of the moment. He never went into\nDK: His past.\nRR: I mean, again, it’s like, knowing everything I know now, and of course, I met so many of the people at that time, but I had no idea really the histories, other than having read Close to the Knives which again, was just sort of like a bit of a weight. Like, what could I ask him? Maybe now, with a different kind of confidence, I would have asked him about parts of that book or why he did what he did. But it was like, it just didn’t feel right.\nDK: That makes sense. So Wendy had recalled, but maybe the timeline was shifted for her, she was remembering getting wood cut for painting work and having that delivered to his loft.\nRR: It could have been. Though I know, the only work that I remember installing as a show were the four Flower paintings. So it’s very likely that I may have helped get the wood together, because I would do that at the gallery. I built shelves and all of that kind of stuff. So I don’t remember delivering the wood. I do remember the Flower paintings. And I remember hearing, and it might have been from Gary or John, that David was never happy with those paintings. He felt like he didn’t paint them well enough, and he was very critical of them. And I just remember just being stunned by them because they were – you know, again, his imagery is such a collision of ideas. And then just the penetrating the boards, and cutting things out, and stitching other things in, and text. But I don’t remember bringing the wood. It’s entirely possible.\nDK: I think, because those Flower paintings were done in 1990, so.\nRR: See, I couldn’t remember; I don’t think I had started in 1990. I think I had started in ’91. Because Lorraine and I worked for a year on a show that opened in January. Very shortly after that is when I started at PPOW. So my guess is that the predecessor to me might have done that, because I don’t remember bringing wood.\nDK: Or ever bringing work from his studio apartment to the gallery?\nRR: We were doing, I remember the production of the photographs, and also the boy, One Day This Boy Will Grow Up [sic; global]. And I remember that. I could have brought those. What would have happened is, bringing them for signing, or something like that. And it’s entirely possible. I do remember a conversation with John, or no, it was Gary, because the prints had been made and they weren’t mounted yet. And we were trying to figure out where to get them mounted. And I remember talking to Gary because I was very concerned that the materials be archival, so that they would last. And of course Gary shared that. But Gary didn’t have mounting facilities at that time. So I don’t remember where we did it, but it’s very likely that I might have gone there for him to give his signature. If there were other things, I don’t think so. Because at that point, he was producing things that were, I mean, the Boy print is about this big. So that could have very easily been brought. The large photographs, I probably would have brought maybe in a car. And the proof was just to make sure that the screening of the red, When I Lay My Hands on You, or Spiral, I think I brought the proof which was the test of the text transfer.\nDK: Oh, okay. I figured it was the photographic __\nRR: That was a photograph. Sorry, I’m confusing the two things. So the When I Lay my Hands on You is photographic, and I do remember, I think it was the proof; right?\nDK: With the text laid on top?\nRR: With the red text over it. For him to see it. That is the time that I think he was too sick. I do have a memory of the One Day This Boy Will Grow Up, that being produced when I was at the gallery, because of the mounting issue. First it was like, ‘Oh, you can just get it mounted anywhere.’ And I’m like, ‘It can’t be mounted anywhere; it has to be archival material.’ I might have brought those to the loft to get him to sign them. They’re kind of completed, __\nDK: I only asked because I had been wondering where the silk-screening was done.\nRR: Gary, I think, would know, because I know that they did the hand-off. I’m assuming you’ve talked to Gary and John.\nDK: Yes. We talked to Gary.\nRR: Gary had a long relationship. They knew, and I often wondered myself because there were other artists who wanted to do things that I worked with, and I never ultimately had the answer. Did Wendy not know?\nDK: __ it was coming through Gary __.\nRR: Well, what would have happened, and this is again my recollection, because Gary did all the printing, so they would have gone from Gary to the silk-screener or screen printer, whoever is doing it, and then I may have gone and got them, or got them at Gary’s. I just don’t remember.\nDK: That’s fine. Wendy didn’t remember.\nRR: It would be good to find out – my guess is Gary remembers. But I’m not positive.\nDK: ?\nRR: I don’t remember, like, at that time, I can’t remember if I, I mean, I knew of Tom and then subsequently met Tom a lot more. And then after David passed away, Tom would come to the gallery a lot. And I really liked Tom and he was always very kind and generous and what have you. And over the years I’ve asked for other things because I did a piece that David was involved in, and he was very helpful in getting stuff together.\nGW: How long did you work for the gallery after his death?\nRR: You know, I was trying to remember that. What month did David die?\nDK: I should remember off the top of my head, but. I want to say June, so let’s see if that’s right.\nRR: So June of ’92?\nDK: ’92.\nRR: Right. Okay.\nDK: July of ’92.\nRR: Okay. So I remember the day because I went to a bar in the East Village and was very upset. But so, I must have stayed on at the gallery for probably maybe another six months or so. So my guess is, I probably started at the gallery the year before. And if I went back and looked up PPOW’s archive, I could tell you exactly whose shows I installed and when, and that would definitely date it. But I was definitely there for a while after, at least six months, maybe longer, but I don’t remember. That’s easy information I could figure it out.\nGW: Were there any shows of his work after his death?\nRR: We did the Flowers. And I can’t remember if it was a solo show. I can see the gallery, but again, I erased everything else, so I don’t know. But the Four Flowers were definitely exhibited. I don’t know that it was the only time they were shown, especially if they were done in ’91 or ‘90.\nDK: I believe they were shown in the PPOW show In the Garden, that he would have been involved in the installation for.\nRR: Okay, so then that predates me.\nDK: Right. So that would have been the year before. But I was just thinking or wondering if you guys were sort of consulting or thinking about that previous show when you were reinstalling the Flower paintings.\nRR: Not that I know of.\nDK: I guess it was in a different context.\nRR: I mean, Wendy probably was thinking about it. It may have even been in the Project room. It might have been solo in the Project room. But I don’t remember talking about it. I mean, I would ask Wendy – Wendy and I were pretty close. Penny was great too, but Wendy was very interested in my thoughts about stuff, so I would ask her questions about David and the work. But I don’t remember any dialogue about “In the Garden.”\nDK: Mm-hm. Or dialogue about any of Wojnarowicz’s preferences for hanging or display? __\nRR: No. I mean, I think everything that we installed, and any time I’ve seen things installed, I don’t think, other than the large installations, so, the Lazaretto, David’s approach was pretty traditional. He didn’t do crazy kind of salon. It was 60 on center, and that’s what it’s going to be. By the way, did you find Stefan Petrik, his framer?\nDK: I have his information; yeah.\nRR: Because he might actually have some very interesting stories. Because he really designed several of David’s signature frames. And I certainly was always going there, on Prince Street, to Stefan’s studio, to pick up work drop work off. And/or get things repaired, because he’s the one that did the kind of reveal black frame with the blue around it, or the red. There’s only a few that were red. The Sex series I think had the red, but most of the others had the blue. But in terms of installation, I think it was very straightforward. But I sadly was ever there with David in the galleries laying out a show or something like that. Which would have been terrific.\nDK: It sounds like it came together pretty quickly, because he would arrive a couple of hours before the show was meant to open. [laughing] That’s what Wendy said.\nRR: Oh, I’m sorry I can’t give you insights into that. [laughter] That’s a shame, although that would have been perfect. I would have been fine with that, because I could get them real quick. Oh, no, no; I’m sorry I’m not the one that was there for that.\nDK: I think Wendy thought that you were.\nRR: Yeah, oh, that’s a shame. Nope.\nDK: Well I’d love to hear more about the sort of conversations, then, if there’s other – there’s a couple of stories about the __\nRR: I mean, it’s like, what do you want to go on record? It’s like, I do remember David, because they must have been trying to do a show, because another conversation that sticks out quite clearly is, he was complaining that Penny, on the last show; it must have been “In the Garden,” I guess, they wouldn’t do a catalogue. And he wanted a catalogue. And he really was not happy. And I think, I’ve already made it clear that Penny and Wendy were also supporting him. And I’m sure no one knows that they were couriering cash, a lot, over, every couple of weeks, or whatever it was. But he was very upset about that, and I think part of it was he knew that the work lived in many ways in that kind of space. Right? That the objects are the objects which enable the ideas to get into the world, but the real kind of exposure would come through publication and catalogues and that. So he was upset with that. I actually think I told Penny this and she just laughed or whatever, like, ‘Oh David,’ you know. So PPOW was, I mean, it was probably for me a great experience in terms of understanding galleries, because they were really pretty good to their artists. And they had many people like David who were doing very innovative, not necessarily saleable, kinds of work. So they, I guess, had to pick and choose what they could do. And I don’t know, because I was never on the sales side of things, we certainly had a lot of work. I regret to this day not having been able to buy some of the work. I did buy one piece, which they let me pay off over time, but.\nDK: What piece did you buy?\nRR: The mummy, a little Mexican mummy film still. It was the only thing I could afford. But it’s great and I’m very happy to have it. But he was upset about the catalogue. But again, my memories of more details or, I don’t think there was a lot, other than just sort of: How are you doing? Do you want to sit and have a cigarette with me? And so it was these kind of interstitial moments in his day of probably not feeling well, getting medication, having nurses come in, and stuff like that. So there weren’t necessarily profound moments, but they were just personally really pretty amazing.\nGW: The reason why we’re digging deep on his concerns for exhibition, the catalogue reference section __[34:34] because we’re trying to help imagine people in the future who will be making decisions about catalogues, about exhibition layout. So his concerns could be very helpful to them. So what you’ve said is actually very interesting.\nRR: Good. He was mad that he didn’t have a catalogue from that show, and he made it clear. But again, the decisions about why it did or didn’t happen, I have no idea. But he would have liked it to happen. And there was definitely, I think, there’s an ego there and he wants his work to be seen, and he wants people to understand something differently than what the world was telling them about AIDS and the death of so many of his friends.\nDK: Do you think he was thinking about his legacy at that point?\nRR: I think David was probably always thinking about his legacy. I think that more in retrospect than I understood at the time. But if you look at how David made work and then who he engaged and what have you, it was clear he wanted to have an impact. I don’t think, like the gallery thing, I think he probably was more comfortable when Gracie and originally Sur Rodney Sur were involved with his work. But when Gracie closed, that’s when the estate and David, well David when he was still alive moved to PPOW. And I think it was a good place for him to land, and I certainly think Penny and Wendy tried really hard. But I think David had a love-hate relationship with the whole commercial aspect of the art world. So the catalogue thing was sort of like a needling about galleries in general, even though I think he also knew that he had pretty much been done right by them, what have you. It was never personal. It was just like, too tight, or stuff like that, just, like, you know, didn’t want to do it. But I also don’t think David was, like, selling, like he is now, so I guess, probably a shrewd business decision.\nDK: Is there anything else that sort of sticks out about that period? It sounds like it was a brief and intense period for you, how it sort of affected you , moving forward; anything he said to you that stuck with you about the art?\nRR: I mean, I think encountering David personally then getting to know his work so well and then reading his work so extensively has had an immeasurable effect. The intersection of content and politics with the creative life is very much where I live. So, absolutely. Just knowing David and seeing that work was like permission. So, yes, there were no single, I mean, there are lines from his writing that I quote frequently. I don’t think there’s anything more profound even at this moment than, “Soon this will all be picturesque ruins,” than that line from David’s text. And it is so resonant and it creeps into my thinking when I’m traveling and I’m in antiquity sites, to a city like this. Because soon this will be all picturesque ruins. Sadly, those weren’t in dialogue. I wasn’t his friend. I didn’t hang out. I didn’t go to bars. I didn’t any of that kind of stuff. It was really through the subsequent writing. And I think I’ve given you all my upper level memories of the time. [laughter] As there are other things that come to the fore, I’ll e-mail you. But for the last weekend I’ve been like, ‘What all did we talk about?’ trying to recall it for you.\nDK: It’s great though. It’s a really interesting sort of brief window into his life at a particular time. So we appreciate\nRR: Well, it was at the end and he was incredibly generous. It was a real spirit, and that’s hard to put into words. The profoundness of David is found in his work. The writing, I don’t think there’s anyone to compare to. I mean, it’s just such a voice and a clear, clear voice. And I introduce it to students to this day, so, it’s pretty awesome. But again, he until the end was just incredibly generous and interested in anyone doing anything creative.\nDK: That’s so nice. Well, thank you so much. And please do feel free to, if other sort of details, and nothing too small, anything comes to mind, that would be really interesting to add to this interview.\nRR: Okay. Absolutely. Cool.\nGW: Yes, thank you; we really appreciate this. It’s very helpful.\nRR: Absolutely. I have a, and this is another thing because I’ve moved recently, I do have a – and I’m sure all of the materials are already here, but I do have a big file of stuff on David that – I would copy stuff in the gallery all the time and it would just get added to my file. So if I find that – I can’t imagine there’s anything in there that you don’t have. A lot of it was about the lawsuit. And I was trying to remember, I don’t remember ever talking to David about the lawsuit. Certainly, Wendy and I talked about it because her brother was, I think, representing him. But there were a lot of things that I was very interested in in that and what Helms was doing, or Wildman, and that kind of stuff. But I can’t imagine there’s anything in there that’s not in the archive here already, but if I come across anything weird.\nGW: You never know. Sure, if you come across that file, we’d be interested.\nDK: Thank you so much.\nRR: All right well, good luck. You guys are really, it’s wonderful you’re doing this.\nGW: Thanks.\nRR: Thank you. And I’m honored to even be here, even though I think what I gave you was pretty limited.\nDK: It’s all, we’re sort of trying to\nRR: Piece it together.\nDK: Yes. Into a multi-faceted polyhedron.\nRR: Well I can’t wait to – this will live alongside all of the paper archives and be accessible\nEND at 41:46\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_Text_with_Robert_Ransick_by_Diana_Kamin_and_Glenn_Wharton_on_8-30-2016&oldid=4355\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterview Text\nThis page was last modified on 4 June 2017, at 12:00.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

So, we will start off with a broad question, though, which is, can you tell us more about your earliest meetings with Wojnarowicz? You met him through Tommy Turner, I believe?\nRK: Yes, I think I met him through, yes, Tommy was a busboy at Peppermint Lounge, the one that was uptown on, I guess it was in the 40s or somewhere. And he said, ‘I’ve got this other friend of mine; he likes to do crazy stuff.’ And it was David. And I think he was a busboy there, too. This would have to be probably ’79, ’80, somewhere around there. Did you read the Cynthia Carr book, I suppose?\nDK: Yes.\nRK: So, I’m curious to see how what I say now __[0:01:00] (laughing) to that, because I don’t remember that at all. But okay, so,\nDK: We can cross check. I think it was around that time.\nRK: David was, let’s see. It was, I hung out with him and Montana Houston and Tommy. And a lot of it had to do with, I was making fanzines and I had started making movies. I met Montana first. I think he was the first person I met here. And oh yeah, I started dating some girl that was the roommate of a girl Tommy was dating. That’s how I met him. And then I met David through Tommy. And then I met Lydia through David. It was all like the way things happen, I guess.\nDK: What were your early impressions?\nRK: Well, you know, you’re always looking for people that don’t think you’re doing weird stuff, and David was one of those, Tommy was one. And we were all into this young fascination with weirdness, I guess, like young people are. And I didn’t know David was gay, I didn’t know Montana was gay, for like years. Not Years, maybe like four or five years. I just never even thought about it because David was like super macho. He was like the opposite of what me coming from North Carolina imagined as a gay guy. So. And so was Montana, by the way. Montana even went so far as to fabricate this girlfriend he had that we never met. David wasn’t like that, though. But yeah.\nDK: And how about his work? When did you first learn about the work he was doing? Did he talk about it?\nRK: No. Now I remember, it was those things on the docks, whatever that was called.\nDK: The Pier Project? The Ward Line Pier Project?\nRK: Did it have a name?\nDK: I’ve just seen Ward Line Pier Project because that was the name of the pier. It was at Pier 34 and Pier 28.\nRK: And David said he’s doing this thing on the piers on the West Side, because he knew I had made -- at the time I was doing this art stuff, but it was more like, it wasn’t really art. It was just me taking Xeroxes of photos that I had shot and I’d print the same photo 50 times, and Montana would put one of his concrete, his cut-out poems, in the middle, and I’d make a whole wall. And we would wheat paste everything. They were super anal, like, arranged. And it would be some kind of hopefully dark, surrealist looking image. And he said, ‘You can have a room in there. I’m just telling anybody I know they can come over there and have a room.’ And I went over to look at it, and it was great. So I did something there. I had a wall. I can picture it in my head. I never photographed it, which was stupid. I did photograph his stuff in there. And he would tell me all these stories about the piers. And then I realized he was gay. [laughter] Yeah, that was a really amazing thing. And it was typical of the kind of thing that me and my friends liked to do. Like the fanzines. Oh, he was doing drawings for my fanzines and things, too. So it was typical of the kind of things we liked to do, that was kind of like illegal or. I don’t know; it was a different New York then. You could – that’s such a cliché but it’s true – where you could do these things. You could just do all kinds of stuff without, first, without anyone noticing. In school, I was really into this idea of like, where I studied I’d got into the idea that art was supposed to be pure. It couldn’t be purchased. Once it was purchased, it was tainted. And I was into process pieces and conceptual stuff, and David seemed to be, too. He was into doing big things in places where nobody was going to get it. There was a lot of people – Keith Haring was doing that, too. And yeah, it just fit right in with what I was doing. And Montana did a lot of drawings. Tommy, he did taxidermy. He did weird stuff like that. He was even weirder.\nDK: What were the fanzines, what was the content, and the subject?\nRK: They were, the first one was called “The Heroin Addict.” That was before I had ever done drugs. And the second one was called “The Valium Addict.” And the next one was called “Dumb Fucker.” And then there was one called “Car and Truck Coloring Book.” And then with Montana, I did “A Key to the Streets of Fear” and “How Magic Works.” Those were two different ones. And this was all HA Productions, or something like that. It was just all like stuff – Montana had – do you guys know all this?\nMT: Some of it.\nDK: Some of it, yes.\nRK: Montana worked at the Ford Foundation, and they had the first Xerox 9500 that I’d ever seen. It was like the first Xerox machine that made photo quality printing in black and white. So, we would go there and print at night. He’d let us in and we could print just like thousands of magazines. So, and that was called, Montana Printers. And then the magazines were free. I just put them out all over the place. Yeah, that was the kind of thing that, you know, was like, we’re doing this for free, for fun. And David was, you know, it was like-minded spirits, I guess.\nDK: I think I’ll move into the filmmaking practice and the work that you did with David there. Was Stray Dogs, Manhattan Love Suicide, the first film that you asked Wojnarowicz to participate in?\nRK: Yes. I’d know him and then lose track of him, then meet up with him again, it seems. It’s all so foggy because I became a bad drug addict at one point there. So it was, Manhattan Love Suicides, that Stray Dogs movie. I had made a couple of shorts. They were all short, but I made a couple of shorts and yeah, in fact, I shot David, one of the shorts was, I shot David making those heads. And that’s a pretty funny movie. It’s very short, like, three minutes of him, like, making these heads and making these faces that go with the heads.\nDK: What’s the name of that film? I must have it but it’s not\nRK: It doesn’t have a name.\nDK: Okay.\nRK: It’s just a, I never put it out or anything.\nDK: I’ve never seen it.\nMT: I’ve never seen it. I didn’t know anything about it.\nRK: Oh, it’s a great one. It’s so shitty. The quality is really bad, and it’s in his apartment, I guess it was on Third Avenue or somewhere, if he lived there; I don’t know. It was an apartment he had. The whole place was like a studio. It was just a big mess. And he was making those heads for that head show.\nDK: At Civilian Warfare?\nRK: Yes. Now, I could have shot this, this could have been before or after Manhattan Love Suicides. It depends on when that was, because Manhattan Love Suicides was ’85. I don’t know when that Civilian Warfare\nDK: It says ’84, the heads, the head show.\nRK: Oh, okay, so, I shot it before.\nDK: It opened in May, so it would have been.\nRK: Okay. So. He was making those things and I was just making these dumb kind of gestural movies. And I knew he did that so, the premise, if there was one, was, it was a guy trying to make his own face look like – I don’t have to describe it. You’d have to see it and then tell me. It’s not very long. But it shows him making those things, and they’re all around the apartment, all over the place. And then he wanted to be in something else, so I put him in -- after seeing him make faces, I put him in this Straw Dogs. He knew Bill Rice, so he asked Bill Rice for me if he would be in it. How much detail do you want?\nDK: Detail is great.\nRK: Okay. So, Manhattan Love Suicides was supposed to be, I’d seen this movie called, this Oshima, I think, movie called The Love Suicides at, and it’s a famous forest in Japan where people go to kill themselves. Someone just told me Gus Van Zandt just made a new movie about it. But I saw that movie, and it’s this young couple who are so in love and they can’t be together, so they go there and kill themselves. And I thought, wow, his is really what it’s like. So the premise of the movie was, people that are so in love that their love kills them. They just can’t handle it. Because that was how all my relationships were. So Stray Dogs was Bill Rice playing an older artist who is being, has this young artist played by David, following him – not a young artist; a young guy, like a young hustler type, following him around. And Bill is not interested in him at all. All he wants to do is paint. And David plays this guy that gets so frustrated like first his neck explodes, and he just keeps getting madder and madder at different things. Like, he sees some photos in Bill’s apartment, he sees a photo of himself, then he sees photos of all these other guys, and he freaks out; he starts blowing up. And then he keeps trying to kiss Bill, Bill won’t let him kiss him, he says because he has bad breath. And David gets so upset then that his arm blows off. And he’s lying on the floor dying. And now that he’s dead, the artist is finally interested in him. Which is also typical of the relationship thing, or not necessarily dead but when somebody’s gone then you become interested. So yeah, that was that movie. And then we immediately, I shot the rest of those with other people, based on, I did one with Tommy, I did one with Zedd, I did one with my girlfriend at the time. Then, David and I were hanging out a lot, and doing drugs a lot. Yeah, he was doing drugs. So we went to cop some heroin on Eighth Street, between C and D, and it was beat, so we were – is this in that book?\nMT: I don’t remember.\nDK: I’m not sure about this particular story.\nRK: Okay. So we go to buy drugs on Eighth between C and D. David had a car. We could just cruise around, he had a station wagon. And at that time you could park anywhere in the East Village. And I was living on 13th between A and B at the time, where I shot a lot of my movies. Anyway, so we go and buy the drugs, we’re sitting there, and there’s nothing like when you’re expecting to get high and you shoot up and it’s fuckin’ beat, and your arm just swells up and you go, “Fuck. That was like fifty bucks.” And I think I was selling Ecstasy at the time, because I sold pot and stuff to pay for those films. And I said, “Hey, let’s shoot up some Ecstasy; see what that’s like.” So we did that, and it was, I mean, you’d shoot up anything when you’re trying to get high. And it was just like such a, like, I picture that warp speed thing in Star Trek. That’s what it felt like. And then you come back and you go, “Hey; I’ve got a great idea!” And you start talking like, we had this, I had met this girl named Lung Leg, one of the Nick Zedd’s girlfriend. Like, this girl Cassandra Stark, she was Nick’s girl. So she comes over one day and says, “I think you should meet Lung.” And that was going to be my girl, but not my girlfriend, just my person I work with. And I had just met her and I couldn’t figure her out. She was probably ten years, fifteen years younger than me, and I couldn’t figure out her scene, even though I had been in this downtown scene forever. Because it was a different generation. They were even more nihilist than we were. I mean, there were subtle differences between the different scenes. But they all amounted to kind of the same thing, but just like a super negativity and thinking everything should be destroyed. That was my scene. And in fact, most of the films I made back then, the whole point of everything was just to fuck up people’s ideas about sex and to make them – I wanted to ruin the way they thought about sex, and I think I was successful with the movie Fingered, according to a lot of people. But, anyway, so, I met Lung Leg, and I couldn’t figure out what is going on with this person, because she had a big X carved in her head – not carved, but she shaved her head a big X on top of her long hair, and it just looked so weird. And this real witchy kind of outlook. She was into demons and all of that stuff. Completely different than – I guess it was kind of a pre-Goth thing, but it was very different than the kind of punk scene that I came from, which was just nihilism. And this had a more kind of a supernatural twist to it, to her scene. Those girls were all into this witchy thing, and the music had changed from like the Sex Pistols to like Einstürzende Neubauten and Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. That was their thing. And bands like Crass, these political bands that I had never really got into. I was more interested in the ones that said let’s tear everything down. So anyhow, I’m giving you all this detail; this is such a qualification.\nDK: You’re in the car.\nRK: Okay.\nDK: With David.\nRK You said you wanted detail, so.\nDK: Yeah, no, it’s great.\nMT: It is.\nRK: So anyhow, David and I are sitting there, and I said, ‘I met this girl and I’d like to make a movie with her. And I could make one where I try to figure out why she is like she is. And I’m going to interview everybody I know and ask them what their parents did.’ And I had this whole plan about how we could be at a dinner, and then you could show – flashback – could show all this stuff. And David said, ‘Well, I’ve got these skeletons I want to do something with. I’ve got this whole family of skeletons I bought.’ And then we worked out that show right there.\nDK: Quick question about the skeletons. Were those skeletons he had bought in Paris?\nRK: No idea right now. I just know he said he’s got a bunch of skeletons.\nMT: I have one question, too. Did he have the child skeleton at that point?\nRK: Yes.\nMT: Okay; that’s great to know.\nRK: I’m pretty sure he did; yeah, because it was in the show.\nMT: Thanks.\nRK: So we pretty much planned out the entire thing sitting there. I said, I’m gonna make this movie. He said, I’ll help. And I think he already had the show for Ground Zero set up.\nDK: So the film and the installation were conceived at the same time?\nRK: Yes. Yes. It was all part of the same thing. So I shot the movie really fast. I still had a job at the time. I worked for this artist, and he went out of town. He would always leave me the keys to his loft, so we shot it in there. And David was the father. And I quickly interviewed everybody, but most of the stories came from David. It was all stuff of David. I think, in the movie, Lung sees her parents having sex. That was from her. And the rabbit getting killed, that was David. The gun, putting a gun to the wife’s head, that was David. These were all stories he talked about, his father. So I just made an outline. We shot it in one day at this loft. David bought the turkey. He said, ‘I’ll get a turkey.’ And David had the car, so we could move stuff around, and just did it really quick.\nDK: What were other props that you guys needed?\nRK: I had the gun, which was such a, it was a starter pistol, and that didn’t really matter. And it was the first thing I shot with Lung, so. I’m just trying to remember this. Montana was in it. I was trying to remember who the original person who Karen Finley replaced was. It was somebody else, and.\nDK: This is in your interview with Lotringer.\nRK: Oh, it is?\nDK: I believe so, I just can’t remember the name. I’m pretty sure you had the names in that interview, so we can look that up.\nRK: Okay.\nDK: And she bailed at the last minute.\nRK: Yes. And then David said, ‘Well I can get Karen Finley to do it,’ which was so great. That like saved a lot of things; she was so good. And there was no script or anything. I just had a list of – this is the way I made all of those movies; I just had a list of what people were going to talk about or what they were going to do. And I would tell them right before the scene, and then we’d just shoot it. And Karen was great, because some of her lines we so fuckin’ funny. And the same for David. Lung, who had never been in anything, said, ‘Hey, I want some drugs.’ So she’s doing Ecstasy in every scene. Like, she would snort a bunch of Ecstasy right before we shot. Like, in the dinner scene, she’s just like __[22:20] and it’s all Ecstasy. For all I know, she was doing other drugs too. Montana helped me with the special effects.\nDK: What kind of special effects?\nRK: When they get shot. When David gets shot, you see the stuff shoot out of his mouth. If you look down at the table, you can see Montana’s knee sticking up there. [laughter] There’s a lot of funny stuff like that that I see now that I didn’t notice at the time. And let’s see, who else is in there? Anyway, all of the people went on to bigger and better things, I guess. Lung, I don’t know about her, but anyway, so we made this movie. It was a quick turnaround.\nDK: What kind of camera were you using at the time?\nRK: At that time I had a Canon, it was a 1250, maybe a 1050. Canon made like three levels of Super 8 sound cameras at one point that were professional cameras. And I think I had the second from the top, whatever that was. And I can remember buying that. It was such a great investment, 300 bucks. But a lot of the old ones I shot on like a really cheap one that I bought from Film Video Arts for like 15 bucks. But this one was great because you could do sound, you could do slow-mo, and all this; you could do manual. It was great.\nDK: And how was the film edited? Did you do all the editing?\nRK: Those little tiny Super 8 things. Yeah, that’s the way I edited all of that stuff. And it’s funny because I remastered all of this stuff recently, a couple of years ago. And I tried to look at stuff on one of those things. And I even bought the brightest bulbs I could find. And I don’t know how I did it. I have no idea. You can’t see anything. I don’t know how that was possible. But even in the pitch black you can’t see anything. So do you have more specific?\nDK: Just also wondering if there are any alternate cuts.\nRK: No. There’s tons of outtakes but I probably just did like one take because a lot of it was things like David chopping up that rabbit. I couldn’t do it twice. It was done. But, let’s see. Incidentally, the artist, I hadn’t seen him for twenty years, and I went to have dinner with him; he’s still alive. And he said, ‘I never did tell you that one time I came back from a trip and there was a dead rabbit in my refrigerator all chopped up.’ And I completely forgot about that, I mean, to like take it out. And when David chops up the table, I had to sand – it was a butcher block table. I had to sand the table. I had to do all this stuff to make sure nobody knew. And then I finally told, the reason he was telling me about the rabbit is, twenty years later, I said, ‘By the way, I shot this movie in here once. I hope you don’t mind.’ And that’s when he told me about the rabbit. [laughter] So, quickly edited it and transferred it to video. I don’t remember where I did it; probably at Brodsky Treadway up in – if that’s what they were called – up in Boston. Because they were the only place I could find that didn’t freak out over my content. Back then, people wouldn’t do your stuff. They would just say, ‘We’re not touching this.’\nDK: That’s so interesting. Even the downtown labs wouldn’t?\nRK: Nope. I mean, they did really good transfers. There was not many places that did incredible transfers, especially for Fingered. Like, nobody was going to do that. So yeah, got it transferred, and it was playing on a loop in the show. Using David’s station wagon, we went around to construction sites and we stole all of the materials to make this room inside the gallery. And I had done construction so I knew how to do all this junk. We built a wall with a window in it. The window was cracked so you could look in. We hauled all these leaves and dog shit and everything into the front, so when you opened the door, you were in a back alley, is what it looked like. I don’t know how effective it was, but, it was dark. David, I think he had recorders in there that had like – this was David’s design, you know. Like, I wanted to do the wall, but he designed, he did all the placement of all the junk. And he had tape recorders hidden that were playing, like, outdoor sounds. And then when you got to the window,\nDK: What kinds of outdoor?\nRK: I don’t know, whatever you’d hear outside, like\nDK: Country outside?\nRK: Maybe like sirens, things like that.\nDK: Okay, so city outside.\nRK: City outside, yes. And when you got up to the window, you looked in and you see the skeletons all bloody and blood all over the place, because that’s the way the movie ends. And up on a loop is, on this monitor, you know how people have a television in their, sometimes when they’re eating, had that set up, and it’s just playing over and over and over. And for the opening, since I was a pot dealer, I would pass out joints before people went in, and say, “You should smoke this before you go in there, just to get a special effect.” And yeah, so that was the show.\nDK: And could you see – we were wondering, because there was this tiny television and it was perched pretty high, you could see it though through the window?\nRK: Yes, it was like from here to the back wall; you could see it. It was about this size, the table was here, and the people were there, and there was a monitor there.\nDK: And so people could stand at the window and watch the duration of the film.\nRK: Yes.\nDK: Like a viewing room.\nRK: Yes and James and Marguerite who owned that gallery, they lived on the wall behind it. And they said that they listened to that thing so much, and they said their kid could recite it from memory. [laughter] But yeah.\nDK: How did you guys find the television that was used?\nRK: And then it sold for a million dollars! [laughter] That would be funny. How did we what?\nDK: The television that was used.\nRK: Davey got that.\nDK: He found it?\nRK: Yeah, David came up with all kinds of stuff. But I really remember driving around, because there were lots of construction sites around. We might have gone to Brooklyn, places like that, and just stealing all this stuff, and then just put it in the gallery. It didn’t cost anything, basically, except for the film, the film and the transfer. That’s about all it cost. And I guess David paid for the skeletons. What happened to those, do you know?\nMT: We have the child skeleton.\nRK: Oh, you do?\nMT: But I don’t know what happened to the others.\nRK: Is it the messed up one from the installation? Because he made a bunch of them.\nMT: Yeah, this one may be a later one. We have photos of David with this skeleton, walking around. Though it was interesting; I was reading something the other day about the installation, and there was a discussion, I think it was this installation, of a child’s skeleton in a white dress. And ours is in a white dress.\nRK: Yeah, that could have been it because it was a, but it would have been covered with blood. And I have photos of all that from then. I have slides and all that.\nMT: This one’s not covered in blood.\nDK: Was it real animal blood?\nRK: I would imagine it was cow blood because you could buy cow blood on First Avenue from the Polish butcher for about three bucks a pint. It was super cheap. And we used that for everything because it looked real, for one thing, and it wasn’t as sticky as the special effects blood, which was hugely messy. But I also bought the body parts, fake stuff I used in a bunch of the other special effects from the same store where you could buy intestines and all kinds of stuff.\nDK: So I have one image of the sort of alleyway exterior here.\nRK: Wow; see, I don’t even have that. Nice. Where does this come from?\nDK: That was another researcher on the project found that. I’m still trying to figure out where she dug it up because I hadn’t seen it before either.\nRK: Wow, this is crazy. Because I don’t remember that part, I just remember the inside.\nDK: Yeah, that was all I had seen as well.\nRK: So that’s David’s painting, too. He would have painted all of that junk.\nDK: He would have painted all of that including the sort of graffiti tags?\nRK: Yes.\nDK: In order to capture the alleyway.\nRK: Yes. It’s interesting because it looks like I didn’t make the wall go all the way to the top. I mean, it looks like I just did the bricks for part. We must have run out of bricks. Can I get a copy of that?\nDK: Sure.\nRK: Can you send it to me?\nDK: I will.\nRK: Great.\nMT: It’s interesting; he’s got his blue going in there, too.\nRK: Yeah.\nDK: Yeah, so it looks like there’s blue and red lights.\nRK: Yeah, there was a lot of that inside the window, too.\nDK: Mm-hm.\nRK: And that film really resonated with people. I still didn’t understand Lung, though. [laughter] I found out later she was mentally ill. So then I understood it, finally.\nMT: Yeah, I remember the first time I saw the film. A lot of us. It’s really powerful.\nRK: Did it seem – I have no idea what people’s effects were, but\nMT: Well, no, it seems funny and real and weird at the same time, and sort of – it’s great. You had to have – there’s no way you could not have a powerful reaction to it. It felt real in a funny way.\nRK: Because I showed these things in Copenhagen, somewhere in Denmark, like, five years ago, a short film thing. They paid me a bunch of money to come, so I did it. And the first thing I got asked was, ‘Why did you make these films? Are we supposed to think they’re good? The acting is terrible, it’s shot bad and everything.’ And I said, ‘Dude; I don’t know. They paid me a lot of money to come here. I don’t care what you think.’ [laughter] But that was the first time I ever thought about the people as actors, or that they were acting. It was more like just going through some motions and, so.\nDK: And was the installation the first time you were screening the film for an audience?\nRK: Yes.\nDK: Subsequent to that, were there other screenings that year?\nRK: Not of that. No. That was pretty much a rush job. Do you have the date on that installation? Because I don’t remember.\nDK: That was ’85.\nRK: But does it say\nDK: Oh, the specific?\nRK: I’ve got it somewhere. But I mean, we turned it around really fast, because I think we shot on Thanksgiving, and it seems like the show was like immediately after that, or, I can’t remember.\nDK: Right. So, yeah, if it was within the same year, it would have been a month later or a few weeks later. I think that makes sense; December, that’s what I remember, too. So it must have been cold outside.\nRK: Yes, it was fall, I remember that.\nDK: And just generally, how would you say David, what was he like as a collaborator? It sounds like there were some decisions that were sort of completely his domain, and others that were completely your domain.\nRK: For that project, I was the film and he was the installation. It was his installation, and I was just making the film that was part of it. And I helped him with the wall. That’s it. When I came to see it, I was like, ‘Oh, this is what it looks like.’ It was good. I do remember he gave me money for the turkey; or he bought the turkey and stuff. And for one of the films, I don’t know if it was Stray Dogs or if it was this one, he gave me like 300 bucks or something to help pay for it. But I don’t remember which one. Maybe it was this one. I’m not sure. Because I think he must have been having shows. I don’t know where he was getting money, but he seemed to have some money. But another thing about him, he was already kind of like a little bit into the art world, because we made fun of him being an artist. Because I myself, I had a whole different image. I told you what I studied and stuff. I was so naïve when I got to New York and found out what the art world was really like. So my reaction was to reject it; that was the basic reaction. And so we all were like that. Tommy didn’t come from an art background; Montana didn’t either. So when David was hanging around with the art people, we thought – kind of like, supposedly he talked about Basquiat when he started hanging around with Warhol and stuff, all that. You know, we’re not the same. I’m sure his friends thought a lot differently of him at that time.\nDK: Did you guys really think differently of him? Or were you just sort of giving him a hard time.\nRK: Just giving him a hard time.\nDK: How did he react?\nRK: Well, he reacted more negatively about the drug use. He really was fed up with that. And he moved into my building. I got him an apartment that was right above me. And my scene was getting darker at that time, it seems, probably because of the drugs. And he told me that he could feel the bad vibes coming up from my apartment. And he didn’t stay there more than a year. But we had a falling out over -- oh, he made a comic for Tommy called, not Redrum, that was the magazine, but a Betty and Veronica comic. Do you guys have that?\nMT: We do.\nRK: I’d love to have one of those. I probably do somewhere. But anyway, that was a really, that’s exactly how he thought about it. Because he was a lot of times, if somebody does speed or something like that, they look down at people who are doing heroin. Everybody does. And like, ‘Oh, I’m above that, you know, because I only do speed.’ I’ve seen this, or I used to see it a lot, when I was a drug addict. But David was one of those types. And it was also this trip we took to South Carolina or somewhere. I think it was South Carolina. And I had a big falling out with him because I’m so homophobic; I’m so paranoid about my own sexuality. Back then I was. It was probably a lot of the drug stuff, because I had messed around with guys, too. And David was just always like, there was a few times where he said, we’d get these hotel rooms, and it’s Tommy and Amy, who are sleeping in one bed; there’s the other bed. And David would say, ‘You can just sleep with me in the bed.’ And I’m like, ‘Dude, I am not fucking sleeping with you!’ [laughing] And we’d have these big arguments about it, and I would sleep on the floor. And I’d say, ‘You’ve got to sleep on the floor next time.’ Even though David was probably paying for everything. It was that kind of thing. And at the end of the trip – this is probably in that book, too -- one of my things I would do was, I’d say, ‘I’ll be right back,’ and then I’d, we were in Washington D.C., and I’d just walk to the train station and get on the train, and said, ‘Let them try to figure out where I went.’ And that really kind of ended it there, right up until he got AIDS, and then I started hanging out with him again. Because I’d got clean at that point. (Sigh.) So. And then I was out of touch with him for a long time, until I got clean. When I got clean, we started talking again. And I think I have letters and stuff from him from when I was – I moved to San Francisco to do my bottom. And when I came back, I think he already had AIDS. I do remember though – do you know when the AIDS started? Was it ’85, ’86?\nMT: Actually it’s earlier. ’81 is really the beginning.\nRK: Well I remember David showing me this article, and I guess it was in New York Magazine, about the new gay cancer, and it was this double-page spread of people in the arts that had died. And he said, ‘Look, I slept with this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy.’ And he was terrified from then on. And he was really concerned that he was going to get it. And his stuff really shifted. And when he got it, it really shifted. But I think he – well, I don’t really know, but it seemed to me, that when he got it, it was not at a good time to get it. It was before they figured it out or he’d still be alive. Because man, when I went to visit him right before he died, in his apartment, it was just like, there was a shelf around the kitchen that was just like drug bottles. And he had a nurse that was, they were just trying everything. I don’t feel like he would have died. But anyway. Some more questions.\nDK: Before we get to that period, one of the things we’re trying to ask about, with all of these interviews, and sometimes people have this recollection or had these conversations with him, and sometimes not, but we’re trying to get some of the details about the equipment that he used, the sort of camera equipment. Or labs, or people he worked with. And it’s surprisingly difficult to pull out.\nRK: Well, Tommy should know some of that stuff, but Tommy’s memory is probably shot, too. I believe David had a camera like I did. I’m not sure.\nDK: A Super 8 Canon?\nRK: Yes. I think he had one. But when he went off to Mexico and made those films, we weren’t talking. I was off on my trip somewhere. I’m trying to remember. I know he had a camera. I don’t know his exact stuff. I remember him showing me stuff in his loft, but I don’t know what it was.\nDK: And he would have been doing his own editing, do you think?\nRK: I suppose; yes. There were other filmmakers he was doing stuff with, because I saw, in that Berlin show, there was one film and it said David Wojnarowicz and somebody else. And it was like a dance film or something. And I was like, this had nothing to do with the cinema of transgression. And then I said, David would flip out if he knew this was being advertised as this and part of this. Because he, a lot of the people that were involved were like, we want nothing to do with this any more because this is super nihilistic and negative.\nDK: With the cinema of transgression?\nRK: Yes. And so he was working with these other people. They might know, if you could figure out what those films were. I know that the catalogue for that show would list that film.\nDK: The Beautiful Strangers, [sic; People] maybe? That sort of dancing guy.\nRK: It could have been; yeah. Yeah, it could have been that. That sounds about right.\nMT: Is that Jesse Hultberg?\nDK: Yes.\nRK: But there’s that period when he – I didn’t even know he was making Super 8s until – I didn’t know about the Mexican films, anything, until I saw them in some show. I did know about Where Evil Dwells because we were doing that kind of the same time. I know Tommy used my camera a lot. But David would have bought his own for that other thing. And there was a lab. I do know the lab, but I can’t remember the name of it, unfortunately. There was a Super 8, the use before video was to shoot your football team or your sports team. And there was a lab in the 40s that, I suppose that’s where it was, and you could get your film back in three hours. So you could, that’s what everybody used, that place. And they didn’t care what it was because they’re not looking at it. It’s just like a processing thing. And it was super cheap, maybe like three bucks a roll, quick turnaround. You’d drop it in the morning, come back in a few hours and get it. And yeah, everybody used that. But that was the last place. There’s still a couple of places I hear, around, but I don’t know why anybody would shoot it. But anyway, that was the lab. Tessa Hughes might know. She has a pretty good memory. Actually, she’d be a good person to ask about this stuff, because he might have borrowed cameras from her or something. But she was still in touch with him a lot more than me in the period when we split up. Yeah, she would know all that stuff. She has a much better memory than Tommy, than me, than everybody.\nDK: That’s great. We’ll put her on our list. Were there other sorts of discussions you guys may have had about work, other kind of media he was working with, paint, or the plaster of the plaster heads, or the sort of sculptural work he was putting together? Were those the topics of the discussions that you guys would have? Or?\nRK: Only that I would look at his paintings. When he was living in my building, he gave me this beautiful huge painting as big as this wall. And then he came down and said, ‘I’m going to need to sell that so I can have some money.’ And he took it back. And that was a sad day.\nDK: Which painting was it? Do you know?\nRK: I don’t remember. I just remember it was great. But yeah, his art thing was, I only saw it in his studio. I never really saw his shows, except until after he was dead, then I saw a lot of that stuff.\nDK: Could you describe what his apartment was like then?\nRK: That apartment was just like mine, except his was renovated. Mine was, it was a six-room railroad. It was probably dirt cheap. He was probably paying about maybe $600 a month. Fifth floor of 13th Street between A and B, 529 East 13th was the building. And I was on the fourth floor, he had the fifth floor. I don’t know if he had a bathroom in his, because mine was a cold water flat with a toilet around the corner that was shared with another apartment. But mine had been walled off, so that I had it to myself. And my apartment was $178 a month and I had moved in when the building was completely, it was all drug dealers and shooting galleries. So I renovated mine myself. I did just a basic tearing out all the stuff that the roaches were hiding in, and kept it like that. And he, his had been renovated by the landlord. And the way I think we both had it set up was, the bedroom at one end, there’s a kitchen in the middle, and then you have like three or four rooms that you could just do whatever you wanted. But they were all open. In his place on wherever it was, maybe on Bowery – do you guys have him living there?\nDK: I think so.\nMT: Third Avenue.\nRK: Third Avenue, yes.\nMT: Peter’s apartment, Peter’s loft.\nRK: No, no.\nDK: Before he moved to 13th Street, it was either Third or Second Avenue.\nMT: It’s earlier.\nRK: Yes, it was on an avenue, I remember that. But that was a very similar setup. That was when he was in 3 Teens Kill 4, that period. It was the same kind of setup except that was completely dilapidated.\nDK: That was where he was working on the heads, where you would have filmed the heads film.\nRK: Yes. Actually, I mean, you can see it in the.\nDK: Yeah. [laughter]\nRK: And then he moved, after my place, he moved into this place on Third Street or Second Street between A and B that was right across from the fire station. I remember there was a girl named Medoca [? 50:20], this photographer, and she got him an apartment in that building. I vaguely remember that. And then the one that he moved in, the next time I was talking to him, he was in that, in Peter’s loft on Second Avenue above the theater.\nDK: I was wondering what the kind of studio and work areas looked like.\nRK: Like a mess. But that would be normal. I mean, even, I remember the one in my building was less messy than all of the other ones.\nDK: I think at some period in there he wasn’t painting for a while. After the Whitney Biennial supposedly he took a break from painting.\nRK: See, I didn’t even know about the Whitney Biennial. We were like so out of touch with that world that David went into, that art world. I do think he got, like, was it, Civilian Warfare, was that guy a bad drug addict?\nDK: Yeah, Dean Savard.\nRK: Yeah, and I know David got ripped off tons, for a lot of money, I recall him saying. So.\nDK: I want to go back to this question of, you said you were seeing these other films of David’s and thinking that it wasn’t consistent with the cinema of transgression, it seemed so different.\n                    RK: Well, just that one.\nDK: Okay.\nRK: But that seemed to, I don’t know. That had nothing to do with it at all. But the Mexican movies and – but we didn’t think of him as a cinema of transgression filmmaker.\nDK: That was going to be my question, yeah, I you considered him part of that.\nRK: No. I mean, it was just me, Tommy, Nick. The whole cinema of transgression, that was Nick’s idea and he was just adding people to it to make it seem like it was a bigger scene than it was. But we had pretty much quit – what were the dates for those Mexican movies? Do you know? Was that like in the late ‘80s?\nDK: Late ‘80s, yeah.\nMT: Yes.\nRK: Yeah, see, the cinema of transgression was over for us, for me anyway, at like ’87 or something. Although I did make stuff after, but that period was about ’81 to ’86, ’87, something like that. And then that’s what I would consider the real period. And then, like I say, I didn’t even know David made films. I’d follow this stuff about – I think that Jesse Helms stuff was happening, it started happening when he was – I can’t remember when he figured out he had AIDS. It seems like he was in my building and he had figured it out because I remember him telling me about the censorship thing. And his lawsuit; I remember that.\nMT: ’88 is when he was diagnosed. So about six months\nRK: He wasn’t in my building then. He had already moved on then. And I left around that time myself. I left around ’87 for six months.\nDK: Is there anything else that you feel like hasn’t been discussed in your previous interviews about Wojnarowicz or that we haven’t touched on today that you think is important for researchers to know about that period, about his sort of values or?\nRK: The only thing, I don’t know if I said this in the other – I probably just repeated everything the same, but, he always told these crazy stories about being a hustler and stuff and being a runaway and all that. And that gave him an authenticity. Then Cynthia Carr, it seems like she told me that a lot of that wasn’t true, that he didn’t live like that. Do you guys know? I have no idea. He had an apartment -- his mother lived in Hell’s Kitchen and that’s where he actually lived.\nMT: It’s complicated. I think he fabricated some of it.\nRK: Yeah, that’s what I think.\nMT: There may have been some of it, but not nearly as much as he let on.\nRK: Yeah, I do remember him telling me him sleeping in a building with a clock tower or something, that he lived in there for a while, him and some other guys. And when he was telling me this stuff back then, I was like, wow, this is so heavy, man. But I don’t know if that was real or not. And the same thing, like, Montana told us how he stabbed this drug dealer and I think he killed him, and we never could figure out of that was real either. It could have been. I could never figure out if Richard Prince actually grew up in the Canal Zone. [laughter] Who knows.\nMT: A lot of self fabrication going on back then.\nRK: Got it?\nDK: Yes, well thank you so much.\nMT: Thank you.\nRK: Yeah, because it’s time for your other interview.\nMT: This was great; thank you.\nEND at 0:55:58\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_Text_with_Richard_Kern_by_Diana_Kamin_and_Marvin_Taylor_on_8-30-2016&oldid=4353\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterview Text\nThis page was last modified on 4 June 2017, at 11:50.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

I’m Diana Kamin and I’m interviewing Wendy Olsoff at PPOW Gallery in New York. So I thought we could start at the beginning. I have a list of questions here and we’ll see where the conversation goes. My first question was, how did you first learn about Wojnarowicz’s work?\nWO: We had a gallery in the East Village, and he was in the East Village, and it was a small community. So.\nDK: So do you remember seeing some of his early installations? Any memories about those installations that stand out?\nWO: This was a really long time ago.\nDK: I know.\nWO: And I’ve talked a lot about this. We, Penny and I -- Civilian Warfare showed David probably before we moved down there in 1983. And then Gracie Mansion showed David. And we borrowed a piece for a show we did called Indigestion. And we probably went to the openings. I don’t know that I went to the installations. I mean, we saw his work around and about because we were at all the same places he was. We, I don’t think we were the hugest fans of David’s work at that time in the East Village, just because he was with Gracie Mansion, and her gallery and my gallery were very – and I’m friends with her now, of course, but we had very different points of view. And we were in our own sort of world of our own artists, even though we would circulate with the other dealers. So, to be honest with you, Gracie had the Peter Hujar show; I didn’t even go over to see that. In my mind it was photographs of famous people. I did not know that community. So, I knew him because David was in a ton of East Village shows. I really liked his work. I told him that, and I included him in a group show, but it was not, like, a big part of my life in those days at all.\nDK: Right. Okay. I think that the reasoning behind that question was, we’re trying to ask for sort of first-person accounts, if you remember the sights, smells, and looks of some of these early installations that are sort of lost __[0:02:25] So then we can move up to the sort of 1988 period. So, soon after you moved from Tenth Street to the Soho space was when you started working with Wojnarowicz; correct?\nWO: Right.\nDK: Can you describe the context of the move to Soho, and how the gallery space had changed? How the gallery scene in general had changed?\nWO: This has all been documented in other places, so this is repeating, like, the Smithsonian interviews. But it’s fine. So, we were hesitant to leave the East Village because we did not see ourselves, necessarily as, like, a big Soho dealer. What that meant in those days or now is a Chelsea dealer. We did not have that dream, to become a big art dealer. So we really hung out there in the East Village. We were one of the last galleries to leave the East Village, and we did a great show on it, actually, called A Hundred Years of Art on the Lower East Side, which people still remember. Anyway, everyone was like, “The East Village is over.” I’m like, it’s not over. It’s certainly not over. Is it? The Lower East Side seems to have blossomed. Anyway, so, because of real estate and the Tompkins Square Park riots, and the fact that no one would come down to -- we were at 8BC, took over the club called 8BC, where Nan Goldin did her slide show and Karen Finley and Ethel Eichelberger. Our gallery was in that club on Eighth Street. And again, it had nothing to do with David at all, except we knew who he was. In fact, Steve and Walt, good friends of mine and really major collectors now, I remember, when Gracie was closing, wanted to buy paintings from his last show there that didn’t sell, the Four Elements, which are now in their collection and The Museum of Modern Art’s collection and a promised gift. MoMA will have all of them. But Steve and Walt really wanted to buy them and they talked to us about what kind of price they could offer Gracie for it. And that was right when we left the East Village. And Gracie was also relocating and moving. So we moved to Soho because it was cheaper. It was right on West Broadway, kind of where – there were no galleries there at the time, just sweat shops, and on Broadway there was like one retail store. So we got bigger, better space in Soho. And Gracie and David had a falling out, and we asked David to show with us. But first, he was in a small show that Doug Milford did at 560, I think, Broadway. And it was the piece, If I Had a Dollar. And Steve and Walt bought that piece, I think, they definitely did. They bought that piece, and it changed the world, really. Jerry Saltz did a single-page article on that piece for Arts magazine, and it was 1988, so it was like a critical crisis in health care for people with AIDS. And David, with that piece -- which was not even in the main gallery, if I recall; it was like on the side gallery, a small gallery, too – really took on a huge __[5:25] importance compared to who he symbolized in the East Village. In the East Village, David was – and David knew this – was __ with things people hated about the East Village, like the East Village aesthetic. Which, I think now, younger people probably crave to know what it was. But at the time, a lot of people were really snobby about it or denigrating it. And David, because he was so well known, some of his paintings and installations not fitting into the neo-geo and not fitting into any other prescribed school, people perceived as maybe immature or amateur. And angry. And not that important. However, this one painting, I think, made everyone stop in their tracks. And he, from then on -- and we were showing him, he did two more shows with us, his two last shows – he became, really, the voice of everyone who had AIDS, of gay people throughout the country who had no role models. And at that time it was really free __[6:29] computer word got out about him in sort of an underground way, and he gained huge respect across the board, and internationally, as well. So, we were very fortunate, our timing, to have asked him to show with us. We were a gallery known for politics. David was very political, so he trusted us. And we contextualized his work well. We showed other really seriously important political artists. At the time, we showed Carrie Mae Weems as well, and Nancy Spero. So, the gallery knew how to deal with David and his work. Our first show was Sue Coe, who was a really political artist, and our first show with her really taught us how to respect an artist and work with them and not exploit them. And especially if you’re showing political work. And working with Carrie, too. So we were well equipped, and we still are today, how to deal with artists who work with content and make art. So, it’s a special, sort of sensitive way of doing it because, if you’re making political work and you’re in this marketplace, to confuse politics and money becomes very easy for people to point, like, how can you be so political when you’re charging X for this? Or whatever. Or if people ask to put David or whoever in a magazine, we can’t just say yes. We have to really carefully look at the content of that magazine and always be on guard. So, that’s sort of the story.\nDK: Okay, so maybe you can tell me more about the process of putting together an exhibition with David then, at that time?\nWO: Well, we didn’t really put together anything with David. David was a very small part of the gallery’s life. We did not see him a lot. Very different in that he had many relationships and many things going on with different people, and everyone, as has been written about, frequently, by Cindy, and Olivia Laing just wrote about it too, his, and we quoted this, his relationships were intense and separate from each other, and they were equally across the board important to him. And us, as a gallery, was probably the least important. So I don’t have a lot to say, because we were managing his artwork, but his artwork was a means for him to get his message out and make money just to support himself and his own health care, because he didn’t have insurance, to get his work out urgently before he died. And so he didn’t discuss his shows with us very much. He wasn’t like he was coming in, should I make this; should I make that? It was just like, whatever David brought in, we just went with it, because, so, like, his first show with us, he brought it in like three hours before the show opened. He was working on it until the last minute, and we just hung it. And that was the show that had the buffaloes, the Sex series, many important paintings.\nDK: And he didn’t express preferences about the layout or the display decisions?\nWO: Yes, he did. He did. He knew in his head how he wanted it to look. But he brought it in fast, and we hung it, and it looked great. He knew how he wanted it to look, both shows. So it wasn’t like he got in and it was chaos and he just threw work. It was laid out in his mind, and it was put up.\nDK: Did he come in with plans?\nWO: No, he would never – uh, are there any sketches in Fales? Do you see?\nDK: Yes, there’s lots of sketches.\nWO: All right, so, __[9:50] see he planned it out.\nDK: Okay; yeah. And did he\nWO: He might have been carrying them. I don’t really know, I don’t remember.\nDK: It may have been in his head at that point.\nWO: Or he could have had it and stuck them in his back pocket and walked out. You know? We were fast and furiously trying to get a show open in three hours. And then, that first show, he spent a lot of time in our office typing up the catalogue, ITSOFOMO. Because he really wanted to make sure people understood what the work was about. So there’s this great – I’m sure there’s a copy over at Fales, the ITSOFOMO catalogue, he did it in our office and we ran out and got it copied, I think. I can’t really even remember how we got it stapled and put out.\nDK: Weren’t there local copy shops in Soho as a sort of central meeting place for artists?\nWO: You know, I never went there myself, but David’s relationship with Todd’s Copy Shop is famous. But I didn’t go there.\nDK: So there must have been another sort of local shop for printing.\nWO: It could have been Kinko’s.\nDK: There was __\nWO: Or we could have just printed it out on our printer, or our Xerox machine.\nDK: So you had a Xerox machine in your office.\nWO: Yes.\nDK: Okay.\nWO: Yes, we had a really big gallery, much bigger than this gallery, and we had big offices, and we had a Xerox machine. We probably rented it; we used to rent them and there used to be the Xerox guys who would come around. They’d always be these cute, clean-cut guys __ the Xerox machine. [they laugh]\nDK: So then also, I realize this was installed very quickly – if there were other kinds of questions about lighting or framing or anything he may have conveyed.\nWO: David worked directly with Stefan Petrik, our framer, and designed the frames with Stefan. So those red frames around the Sex series that have a red border and the Ant series have a blue border. The Buffaloes had a blue border. He picked the colors, and he designed the frames.\nDK: So those are artist frames.\nWO: They are. When we have the originals in those frames, it really feels like a historical moment. And they’re a very specific color. The red was for blood. And these red lines, if you look at his work, and when you see it all installed at the Whitney eventually, or in the show, you’ll see the red lines and these lines carry through in the paintings.\nDK: Mm-hm. While we’re talking about framers or equipment in the office and everything, is there other information you can think of that?\nWO: David liked to use our fax machine to fax people letters, including Marion Scemama, who he had this immensely emotional relationship with. And she was in Paris and faxes would be going through between them. And he’d come in then to use our fax machine.\nDK: I’m sure some of those faxes are in the archive. I haven’t come across them yet.\nWO: I would think so, yeah. Or Marion saved the ones she got. But there were a lot of them that would come through.\nDK: Are there other sort of printers or film labs or equipment stores you can think of?\nWO: The people he used – and you can talk to Penny separately, because when he did the silkscreens, for One Day, This Kid, I’m not going to remember. It was someone on 14th Street, I think, who printed those.\nDK: Deborah Wye thinks it’s Giant.\nWO: Deborah Wye would know, and Giant sounds familiar to me.\nDK: Okay.\nWO: And the person, Gary Schneider – you’re going to talk to Gary; right?\nDK: I’ll make sure he’s on our list.\nWO: Gary Schneider printed the Hands and the Skeletons. And then someone silkscreened the text over it. It was someone who silkscreened that text over it, but I don’t know who it was. Penny might remember. Otherwise, we provided David – like, we were getting him the materials for the paintings, like the window paintings, like when we did the second show, In the Garden, there were those flower paintings? I think we cut the windows to his specifications; that’s what I remember. But we’d get the panels for him. We were always calling him, saying, “Do you want? Can we get anything?” For that second show, too, we had to bring everything to him, he was so weak. So we would bring stuff to the studio. I wouldn’t. Robert Ransick, he teaches at Bennington, was our art installer, and he remembers going to David’s loft with stuff, and he laughs about it now. He says, “Oh my god.” And we always had to give David money, too, so, a lot, it was in cash. Somebody would bring over cash for him, and Robert would be our courier. It was an amazing experience for him, intensified in hindsight. So we tried to make sure his stuff to make art was delivered to him so he could make art.\nDK: Including supplies, paints?\nWO: I just remember the wood.\nDK: Cut to specifications.\nWO: Yes. So he could paint those flowers. That’s all I remember. You might want to ask Penny separately.\nDK: Okay, and Robert, it sounds like.\nWO: And Robert Ransick on the phone might give you some information, because he was our art installer in those days. And our director, Scott Cato, might remember stuff, as well. He lives on the Cape now, and is super nice, and he was very involved, too. And people don’t interview those people, Robert and Scott, very much, but they might have some memories that are unique.\nDK: Yeah, I think you can tell, this resource is going to be directed toward curators and conservators and researchers who are interested in preserving and displaying his work, and a lot of what’s missing from the existing material is these details about process and technique, and reconstructing that. I talked to David Kiehl, and he’s exploring the media of One Day, This Kid, he doesn’t think it’s a photostat.\nWO: He doesn’t?\nDK: He said that to me in a sort of informal conversation, so I think he’s researching it now, but he has questions about the medium.\nWO: Yeah, it wasn’t something that we were – we have no pictures. In other words, we have no, like now we have studios and take a picture and post it on line. In those days, we have nothing but memories.\nDK: Right.\nWO: We never took any photos. Never. And we never really – you know, we were living, pretty much, really basically, just trying to keep our doors open through the various recessions and what time we were in, not really doing our best.\nDK: Were you taking installation photographs?\nWO: There are installation photographs of David’s – I don’t know how detailed they are, but there are some. Of that first show, I can see them in my head, so we have those. Annalisa will send them to you. The second show was with the Rimbauds were in the front room and then, In the Garden – we should have it.\nDK: That’s great.\nWO: But it’s not like we do now.\nDK: Yeah, __[16:40 extensive? Expensive?]\nWO: We just really couldn’t afford photography on that level.\nDK: Continuing in this vein, another\nWO: __. Sorry.\nDK: Oh, that’s all right. Another question we’re trying to look into is the camera equipment that Wojnarowicz worked with, so just in case you had any recollections of equipment that he may have had in his studio.\nWO: I rarely ever went to his studio. I mean, we didn’t do studio visits with David. Sometimes he’d come in the gallery and just talk, but it wasn’t really about that kind of thing. It was more about, oh, I had a dream last night. Or politics, romancing and raging about what was going on in the world. But we weren’t really talking to him – everything had much more urgency and it really wasn’t like planning ads and stuff like that. I mean, it was just a much different conversation.\nDK: But you were talking, it sounds like, about things like placement, and\nWO: No.\nDK: No. Okay.\nWO: No, and I never went to his studio. I never said, “Oh, your show’s coming up; time to make a studio visit.” It was not like that.\nDK: He would show up with the works.\nWO: Yes.\nDK: How would he transport them?\nWO: We’d send a truck.\nDK: Right.\nWO: Or maybe Robert drove it, or we’d send a little trucking company. Nothing major.\nDK: And then you’d see the work for the first time in the gallery space.\nWO: Yep, that’s right.\nDK: And he would come and install it.\nWO: With us; yes.\nDK: With you.\nWO: That’s what I remember. I don’t really remember working with him that much on the installations, but I know he must have done it, had it laid out, then we just put up what he wanted. But there wasn’t like the kind of planning other artists need, a lot.\nDK: And there weren’t sort of any unusual installation decisions that stand out in terms of hanging or?\nWO: No; it was really clear in David’s head, like, where the Ant series were going to go. There was a chair with a mask on it and these wooden antlers. And I don’t remember the installation being a big part of our relationship, but I remember the shows having great installations. I think he just knew what he wanted to do.\nDK: In terms of discussions you may have had about his legacy, did you have any discussions about reconstructing early installations? Or about the early installations being kind of part of his\nWO: Which installations? You’re talking about our shows; right?\nDK: I was thinking about the sort of installation work he did at Ground Zero or\nWO: But I never did that.\nDK: Right.\nWO: We just recreated an installation as best we could at the Frieze.\nDK: Yeah, I was going to ask about that, as well.\nWO: So that would be one example. I never saw the James Romberger show. I assume that most of those heads and skulls and things are dispersed.\nDK: Are dispersed to different collaborators.\nWO: Recreating them, you know, they were in weird situations. I don’t know that it’s possible to recreate those things. And we thought we would recreate the New Museum piece, Heads of State.\nDK: Right.\nWO: But we just don’t have all of the pieces. It wouldn’t be impossible to do it, I don’t think; it would be, parts would be missing. I would have loved to recreate the New Museum piece, but.\nDK: Do you think, in cases like that, it would be better to reconstruct missing elements, or leave the missing elements missing? To include sort of documentary photographs to indicate what’s missing? Different strategies.\nWO: I don’t know. And that one has a really huge papier maché head.\nDK: Papier maché head; yeah.\nWO: I think it would lose a lot, not to have some of the major pieces. I mean, I think there should be an inventory done of that piece, to see what we have and what’s missing. So if you ever know anyone who wants to do that, we could use all the help there is. And I honestly don’t know the other installations; I didn’t go to see them.\nDK: So then for the installation that you recreated or that you included in the Frieze, could you walk me through that process of how you, the steps that were taken in order to pull it together? If there were documentary photographs consulted or installation plans or the sort of core elements that you think are necessary in order to recreate an installation.\nWO: Well, that’s a little different because years ago we were called by Robert Pincus-Witten who worked for Mnuchin at the time. And this was a while ago; I would say the beginning of the 2000s. And he said that this painting was in Mnuchin’s basement, did we want it? At his gallery. And we were like; what is it? Let’s go down and see. And we saw it and we really didn’t even realize what it was, but we were like, “Oh my god; that’s amazing.” It was just eight panels that made the backdrop. And we brought those to the gallery, and then we got a call sometime later and they said, “Oh, we found all these skulls.” So then we started doing the research and realized we had that entire installation. And then I think it was 2008, Jason Murison, he’s the director of Petzel Gallery now, did a show called Big City Fall. So we had all, I mean, you can see the pictures Peter Hujar took of Mnuchin’s basement. We could find out the story; it’s in the Lower East Side book that Semiotext did. And we could recreate 90 percent – we can’t recreate a basement. We can’t bring all the dirt. We could, bring all the dirt and garbage in that David found on the street, but a car door is missing, there’s a globe missing. There are things missing, but I think we have, the painting’s in perfect shape, and what you saw. We have all of those heads, big and small skulls, covered in – perfect; they look like they were made yesterday, because they’ve been in storage. And all of those lights were original, and they were working, and all of the flashers, whatever they’re called, strobe lights that he had on the tree. But it doesn’t really look like the original, because the original was in a basement on the Upper East Side.\nDK: Right.\nWO: So, we showed a photograph with it, of what it looked like. But I think in terms of owning that, for a museum would be a great thing, because that’s as close as people are going to get to having a complete installation of David’s.\nDK: Right. And then, so, moving on to other kinds of non-traditional elements that are exhibited often with Wojnarowicz’s work, I’m thinking about the journals specifically, you’ve exhibited, PPOW exhibited journals, he displayed his own journals during his lifetime as part of installations.\nWO: He did at the New Museum, or?\nDK: At Ground Zero.\nWO: Ground Zero; you want to speak to James and Marguerite. I really wasn’t; I didn’t see those shows. I don’t know. He showed his journals at Ground Zero?\nDK: Yes, I believe so, as part of an installation.\nWO: Think so? Okay.\nDK: Yeah. So I was just wondering if you have suggestions or thoughts about exhibiting this documentary material. It’s not classic documentary material. Do you think he thought of his journals as artworks?\nWO: I think David thought of everything as artwork. In other words, I don’t know that David would think: Oh, I didn’t expect you to show that! Or do that. Like, if he were around today, I’m sure he’d be pretty surprised, but I think, like many great artists, anything that they have and they touch has a certain power and a certain relevance. Were they artworks? No. His writings and his journals were his writings, and his journals were separate from his artworks. Although sometimes they cross, because we had text in pieces. But I think a lot of the times, David, and certainly from his earlier days, and in Cindy Carr’s book, he thought of himself as a writer. So, it’s fascinating to see an artist’s – every museum shows it. I don’t know that David showed them. I can’t believe that’s true.\nDK: Okay, I’ll check that.\nWO: I can not see him actually thinking: I’m going to show my journals. It just seems wrong to me.\nDK: Right. Okay, I’m going to fact-check that.\nWO: A private person like that. And no one in those days was showing journals. This whole mania for people’s archives and journals and showing process, is new. And archives, interest in museums buying archives and seeing archives is relatively recent. Academic and new way of exhibiting artists’ work. So I would just check into that David showing his journals. You know, he wrote great postcards to people; that’s another thing. I don’t think he expected them to be seen, but they’re going to be.\nDK: We also have, there’s material in Fales from, you know, figurines and Kachina dolls, and\nWO: Well, the Magic Box.\nDK: And the Magic Box, of course. And these sort of elements that are archival objects that are not finished works that may have been included.\nWO: Well, it’s a very interesting conversation about, and we have it constantly, what’s art and what’s archives. And once museums and collectors start buying archives, they always are less interested in giving them or signing them to libraries, because they always can make money from it. So a lot of times, I think now, the line’s really blurred. And we try to keep it pretty clean; like, this should go to Fales. Carolee Schneemann, for example, is another one who made those decisions when her archives went to Stanford. It’s like: Let’s keep this; this is art; and this isn’t art. But it’s sometimes kind of arbitrary.\nDK: And with someone like Wojnarowicz in particular, do you think that he felt that there was a strong division between the sort of artworks that he knew or may have hoped were bound for museums and private collections?\nWO: David never thought like this. The problem I have is that, like, David was thinking about politics and about survival, and about his friends’ survival. He was being sued by the American Family Foundation; he was being bombarded by the press. He was an activist, and his performance and his collaboration with Ben Neill and Richard Kern, all of these other people, and his films about AIDS that he did, this is what he was thinking about. He was not thinking about the system, and he did not give a shit about it.\nDK: Mm-hm. I think that answers, that might answer __[laughter and speech]\nWO: __ someone else came from Fales and she was a doll, and she was like, doing something about archives, and should artists be taught to archive; I’m like, some of these artists don’t care. And the best ones don’t. So. It’s not going to fit in, like, teaching people to archive their work. That would not have been David. And if he was sitting home thinking about what should I save, and what should I not save, and what will go this, where, and there.\nDK: Or about long-term preservation, or about __\nWO: He’s thinking about living. [laughs] It was like in a war zone.\nDK: Yeah. Well then, as someone who’s working with his work now, how do you approach questions of conservation? I guess we could also even go back to the Frieze installation, it was so fascinating. Would you, could you imagine showing that installation with new garbage, or new __\nWO: I’d say, if someone wants to go further and try to recreate the basement, once it gets to a certain point – we have this with Martin Wong, too, and the Martin Wong show at the Bronx Museum, for example. And I can see that once the curators start curating, and they have the best intentions, and they’re geniuses, and I love them, and it’s all great, they might think: Oh, well this piece should be shown this way. And there’s no way that, like, we can speak for an artist who never left instructions, and say, so-and-so would never have wanted that. So we try as hard as we can to say, I really think that that should be this way, and doing that seems really not right. But it becomes a battle with the curators. And you have a David Kiehl or a Sergio Bessa, or all these people, they’re really taking on, it becomes their project, too. So, it’s kind of a living thing. And it’s because, some artists, like, I read or heard, someone told me Bruce Conner, who’s at MoMA now, left specific details, specific instructions on how every film should be shown. With David, we have nothing like that. So, while at times we, like, we have a record of all of his collaborative films and stuff, but they weren’t like completely stamped with his final seal of approval. And then I was just reading Olivia Laing’s book, and she told me at Fales, there’s all these recordings, like audio recordings. And I thought, I should really go listen to those. Which I never did. And you know, can that be integrated into an exhibition somehow? So you just have to try to respect the work. I think we do a really good job of it, and not exploiting it, and not making lots of copies of things, and not showing it in venues that we don’t think David would appreciate, and all that. But there’s no way, really, to know.\nDK: Without explicit instructions, it will always be an interpretation. Even with instructions, it’s an interpretation.\nWO: The artist would have to say, like, I want these things hung five inches apart, 60 inches off the ground, everywhere.\nDK: In perpetuity.\nWO: Some artists do that. They’re like, and I don’t want to be shown with any other artist __[31:07] my work without any other artist in that room. But these artists, David never thought about it. He wasn’t really thinking about, like, I was going to be super famous one day, and there’s going to be scholarship about me. I think he’d be shocked that he’s still remembered at all. And that we’re still talking about the same issues.\nDK: [laughs] Yes. Politically, you mean.\nWO: Yes, like Orlando, and what happened down there.\nDK: Of course.\nWO: Sort of like the same homophobia, same issues, to some degree.\nDK: And his work is resonating\nWO: Constantly.\nDK: With a new generation.\nWO: Oh, yes.\nDK: And after events like Orlando, you see his work popping up on Tumblr and blogs.\nWO: Right, exactly. He’s becoming a voice for gay rights. And he was in his lifetime, too. Which was a lot of pressure on him when he was ill. He was really weak, and he was __[32:05], to finish his writings. He really wanted to get his writings done. And I think if you look at the last writings, he expresses himself very clearly about doing as best he can.\nDK: I have another question that will be – I am anticipating a similar answer, that he wouldn’t have given a shit, but [laughs] part of the thing we’re struggling with because we’re building this resource,\nWO: I know, I know; I appreciate that.\nDK: Is describing, kind of coming up with media categories that describe his work. So, for instance, works on paper, photography, there are some traditional categories that we can work with. But we’re struggling with wall-bound multi-media works, the Fear of Evolution with acrylic, string, text, photographs, and Masonite. I’m just wondering how the gallery approaches those questions.\nWO: I think of those as paintings. I could call them mixed-media, but I think of those paintings as paintings.\nDK: Yes, paintings with collage elements __\nWO: Or __ media something , the ones with the windows and sewn in and with the collage, where he’s painted over it; we consider them paintings.\nDK: Okay, that’s helpful.\nWO: That’s how we think of it. But someone else, like David __ they’re not paintings, they’re collages. [D laughs] But again, as you said, who really gives? [they laugh]\n                    DK: I guess it’s available to research or re-thinking about\n                    WO: Yeah, but if you put a label on it, it becomes one thing and not another. So, these labels are very limiting, I think, maybe less productive than productive way to spend time. In my opinion. I don’t know. David, in his lifetime, we called them, if you look at our original checklists, which we have somewhere, you’ll see what they are, what they were.\nDK: Yes, we have a selection of them. And then I think I’m going to follow up with Elisa to make sure that we have everything we can get our hands on.\nWO: Yes, double check it all, because again. Yeah, it’s good. You know, even today we are always just like trying to get it right. Galleries are not museums, and we’re not trained museum people, and we have a lot of demands, and it’s very hard to get the details right all the time.\nDK: Mm-hm. For museums, as well. It’s ongoing.\nWO: It’s just, the history, it’s just everything, by the time something’s published, there’s a mistake in it, whether you\nDK: Yes.\nWO: And so it perpetuates mistakes.\nDK: Yes. Well, that’s why I think having the historical version, examples of checklists, and published pieces, and installation photographs, are just getting as much information as we can in a searchable space, is our sort of contribution to future researchers.\nWO: Right. Yes. It’s worthwhile, because future researchers will never be able to do what you’re doing right now.\nDK: Talking to the people who worked with him.\nWO: Yes. Yes, certainly worthwhile. So, framing was not a big deal. He designed those frames. His paintings had little slat frames on them. Whenever we see work of David’s, we can tell, because the corners of the Masonite are like not perfect. His work, and Martin’s, too, but David’s had an imperfection to it. It wasn’t like slick, polished work. It was rough, and the edges were rough. So he would just nail on a two by half an inch by two (2”x.5”x2”), paint it black, nail it on, or stick it up. Now we get frames made that look like that but they’re better quality.\nDK: More stable, I assume.\nWO: They’re usually stabilized. They’re really great material but they look like a slat frame David would have designed. We don’t put his works in major frames that are antithetical to what originally\nDK: That’s important.\nWO: Yeah. And Stefan Petrik is still around, the guy who did the original frames with the blue lines. So again, if you wanted to talk to Stefan, he worked directly with David, the framer who designed those frames with David, he can tell you information. No one’s interviewed him, I’m sure.\nDK: That would be great.\nWO: So, this is important. Like, Robert and Stefan __[36:15], they’re all about. And everyone has their stories and their point of view. So, you’ve got to sort of sort out what’s fable and what’s real.\nDK: Or also just gather it and make it available. We’re taking the sort of archival approach of trying to -- obviously, any formal organization is interpretation to some degree, and Marvin talks about that more than anyone.\nWO: Any form of?\nDK: Of sort of organizing material into an archive, it is interpretation,\nWO: Right, exactly.\nDK: Involves some act of interpretation. But we’re trying to sort of present the material that we have gathered as it is, to be descriptive rather than proscriptive.\nWO: I think that’s great.\nDK: So are there other? We have Robert, Stefan, Gary.\nWO: Yeah, Gary Schneider, Robert Ransick.\nDK: Jesse, that was Analisa’s suggestion.\nWO: Well that’s __, [37:20] which is different. But Robert Ransick who is at Bennington, teaches there; he was our art installer. Scott Cato was our director, who might remember more about like what kind of copiers we had and where he printed things.\nDK: Mm-hm, and he’s on the Cape.\nWO: He’s on the Cape. These are people you can find; I can get you their e-mails. Stefan Petrik, I think he’s up by Beacon, he has a frame shop, still. We still use him, when people buy a print and want an original frame, because he still can reproduce that color of blue that he and David designed, the Sex Series frames. And then, um, that’s it.\nDK: James and Marguerite talked about Utrecht Blue as a blue that he used all the time, and that was an important color to him.\nWO: Yeah. And David had different relationships with James and Marguerite, with us, with many, many other artists. So, you’ll find bits and pieces all over.\nDK: We’re going to have a section on this knowledge base that we’re building that points researchers towards the other archives and institutional holdings. How would you like us to describe PPOW as a resource for Wojnarowicz researchers? You have a description of the sort of holdings that the gallery – would you want to direct researchers to the gallery?\nWO: Yes, by appointment. We’re going to actually be taking another space in this building and we’re going to have a library. Right now we just have bookcases in the back, and we need a place where people can come. So we will have a place people can sit and do research, but it’s not going to be like Fales where you’re going to see archival material. We’re not going to start to pull out old files or anything. There might be tons of David’s books and catalogues from shows he’s in, that kind of stuff. Because right now we don’t have room for it but we’re planning in September to build that.\nDK: So we can follow up about that.\nWO: You can follow up about it, but it will be a place where by appointment you can come and sit down and there will be all of the current shows he’s in, Art AIDS America, whatever it is, we’ll keep the catalogues. Now we don’t even have room for that. So we’re going to start doing that in the fall, building a library that was intended to be for curators and students and collectors.\nDK: Great. That’s terrific.\nWO: Yeah. So we’re trying to help people do that for our artists, because we’ve never been able to before, and we think now we can. So, that’s good.\nDK: __historical __ historical material now\nWO: Yes, and we have so many requests for people coming in and it’s very time consuming, and we don’t have it at our fingertips. If we can just seat someone at a desk and show them where the books are, they can sit and do their research here.\nDK: Great. Do you feel like there are questions that you don’t get asked about Wojnarowicz? I know you have done many interviews and you’ve written about this and you’ve discussed it elsewhere.\nWO: You mean something that’s important to know that no one’s ever asked me before?\nDK: [laughs] Yeah! [laughs] Or times when you get pictures and say, “People never ask about X.”\nWO: I can’t really think of that off hand. There’s nothing, really. It’s just amazing to me that you can have this person in a short time, intense time, making this body of work that is so rich. You know? And I don’t think anyone, I don’t think he even knew. Like I always think, that’s why I said he would be so surprised, because he was so racing against the clock, and he died so young, that there’s such an endless amount of people interested in this short life. I know there’s a lot of examples in history like that, but to see it, how it happens and how it’s created. I was just reading Olivia Laing’s book – did you read it? I just was reading it last weekend. And it’s like, oh my god. And she’s reiterating a lot of what’s already been said, but it’s getting to a wider audience now, too. And the whole environment, with Peter and the way she ties David now in connection with Darger or Hopper. With everyone on the book, there’s this string of connections. It’s fascinating to watch evolve, from my point of view. So I’m very privileged.\nDK: Because of how sort of circumscribed the scene and the circle felt during his lifetime?\nWO: Yeah, it felt like, because in a way, we were all earnestly doing everything we could when we were pretty young, in a very dire time. I think there’s no way of really appreciating what the AIDS crisis was like for someone who didn’t live it, if you were in the midst of it and your friends were gay. There’s just no way that you can compare that to anything going on today. I don’t think. So, and then to think that people are trying to understand what was going on by recreating, like, what was it like. I think Cindy did a pretty good job in her book. It was a pretty hard book to read, I thought.\nDK: Yeah.\nWO: But I mean, it’s just funny, that’s all.\nDK: Yeah. And then it, in terms of, I know Marvin and Glenn, they’re the two heads of this project, have talked about or have asked people about the appropriateness or thoughts around the showing of Wojnarowicz’s work in a white cube environment.\nWO: Well David showed it, and that’s where he showed it. I mean, he did other things, as well. So we always let people run with the ball if I find that they’re an interesting person who has a great idea and wants to put it in a downtown space or a non-profit space or whatever, as long as it’s well thought out and political and it’s something I would think David was interested in, go do it. And then we provide them with the material to do whatever, for rallies, for performances, for so much.\nDK: That’s really nice.\nWO: So we do grant a lot of license to things that aren’t major.\nDK: That’s really interesting. And so, throughout this conversation, I think it’s become clear that it’s not about his sort of formal considerations, it’s about the intellectual or social context.\nWO: That’s the most important thing. Because that’s what David, I am completely sure, that’s all he wanted to do, was make society more tolerant. So, that’s what our mission is, in my mind.\nDK: And he wanted his work to reach people.\nWO: Reach a broad amount of people, and reach people who can make change, and protect people. So, that, I feel, is what we try to keep doing. And so, we’d more likely say yes to something small that we think is great, than something that would be completely something David wouldn’t ever want. Not that people ask that much with David; it’s a very specific set of artwork that’s not going to be integrated into something too shallow. So, I think that’s really the purpose of the future, when people work with David’s work, they have to honor the integrity of his mission and what he represented.\nDK: Yeah.\nWO: [Aside: Eliza? . . .] So I think that’s, going back full circle to what I said at the beginning, and why David, I think, wanted to show with us and why he trusted us, and why, and because of the people we showed, like Carrie Mae and Sue Coe before him and with him. It takes a certain type of integrity and a point of view to have a gallery that is both commercial and political. And so we try to work with people who understand that. And I think we do. I think they come to us. Our collectors who buy David’s work are really very specific types of people who know more about David because there’s so much research. They aren’t buying it for resale. We don’t want to sell or put work in places that are too commercial. That would take away from his integrity, his message, which is vitally important. So I think that’s what we would ask future historians to pay attention to. And I think they will.\nDK: The work demands it.\nWO: The work demands it. But you never know. I think David’s work resists it. I think he created it to resist -- there’s a certain resistance to commercial exploitation he’s built into the work.\nDK: Yes. Well, I think that’s a good place to end, then.\nWO: Okay. If you have follow-up questions, of course, I’m. In terms of, I think it’s really important what you’re doing, actually. I finally understood it more, as we talked. Yeah, the same thing goes with the framing and the production, we keep those values David had in the way we show the films, the way we install shows. We do have installation photographs. I mean, there’s ways of doing it that we think make sense, that make it a Wojnarowicz show, not just a.\nDK: Oh, and those are?\nWO: Like, if you look at that show we did, Spirituality, or the booth we did in Basel, Switzerland, I think those booths, in a certain way, we try to keep it looking sort of like the shows we did with David.\nDK: Right. And they look, then, distinct from the other\nWO: Booths, yes, totally. I mean, a lot of it’s the work, but, and it’s amazing that you can throw the work together from the ‘80s and ‘90s and mix it up, and that’s what’s so incredible is that it still all works together and speaks to each other. And there, in fact, lies David’s brilliance in that the work he was doing very early on, to what he did the very last, it all made sense. Which he didn’t really articulate clearly all the time, because he didn’t have time to reflect. He was too busy. But it’s there now, so there’s a lot of opportunities for research.\nDK: Working with a repertoire of forms and themes and sometimes specific images that recur throughout.\nWO: Throughout, right, and he just kept evolving them. And had categories, that he saw things in categories.\nDK: Yeah, which makes this Web project both a really interesting opportunity, because he’s such a particular kind of artist. Because it seems like it could translate really interestingly into a sort of environment where you can categorize works in ways where they can sort of hyperlink to each other, be arranged in different ways.\nWO: Right.\nDK: But there’s also a concern about being too rigid, because the image might not mean the same thing in every context.\nWO: Right.\nDK: So it’s something that we’re trying to__\nWO: I think a lot of research could be done with the Native American imagery, that’s never been done. Because when I did the show at Basel, we kept seeing these arrowheads and Kachina dolls, and there’s a lot of that, but no one’s ever really.\nDK: The like Snake dancers and the Hopi.\nWO: There’s a lot there. I mean, we don’t have the time to do it, but.\nDK: One of the things, I mean, we don’t have the time before we launch to do everything that we’d like to do, but one of the things we’re working on is to continue to list future projects.\n                    WO: Of possible things to look into.\nDK: That would be strong research.\nWO: That would be a good thing, rather than the same thing all the time.\nThe interview ends here at 49:20 but the conversation continues until 1:02:20.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_Text_with_Wendy_Olsoff_by_Diana_Kamin_on_7-9-2016&oldid=4358\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterview Text\nThis page was last modified on 4 June 2017, at 12:09.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

I’m Glenn Wharton here with Diana Kamin and we are interviewing Laura McCann, Conservation Librarian at NYU Libraries. So, welcome, Laura; thank you for the interview.\nLM:\tThank you.\nGW:\tCould you tell us first of all just a little bit about your professional background?\nLM:\tSure. So, to start with, I’m the Conservation Librarian at NYU Libraries, a position I started in 2006. And before that I trained in paper conservation with a specialization in books and archives. I trained in the United Kingdom, where I also had studied archeology and art history, as undergrad, partially, and then also in the States. When I moved back to America, I worked at the Municipal Archives for a number of years, eventually being the head of their conservation lab and deputy director. Prior to coming to NYU Libraries, my conservation experience was really centered mostly on very typical kind of government records at Municipal Archives, all the way – obviously, the history of New York is going to be, in terms of the Colonial history, 17th century up to present day. Most of my time I spent there I worked either on Central Park drawings, Brooklyn Bridge drawings, and then some earlier manuscript materials, were the major projects. And other places I worked – rare books, materials, but very little contact with 20th century materials until I came here to NYU Libraries and began working and heading up a conservation program.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[0:01:47]\nGW:\tOkay. And now could you tell us a little bit about the work that you actually do here at the Libraries, and then specifically with the Fales Downtown Collection?\nLM:\tSure. So, when I started here in 2006, the program was very much what’s called a hybrid program, coming from a term that Whitney Baker coined,  is a hybrid conservator, meaning, a conservator who is running both a special collections conservation program, which is much more in the art conservation tradition, and also a collection care program, where you’re really repairing circulating books and managing a preventive program to keep those circulating books coming and going and free of pests, molds, et cetera. Over about the first five years or so, I shifted that program to be almost entirely special collections, which is really perhaps just a response to demands and changes at NYU, but also it remains to be seen if this is a national trend or not. It’s uncertain at this point. Changes in pedagogy and definitely initiatives at NYU at the provost level, we’re really focusing on undergrads using special collections, and that meant that the collections needed to be in condition to be able to be handled, both at the research level, but even more so in instruction and small-group instructions led by both the librarians or in tandem with teaching faculty.\nGW:\tAnd the Fales Downtown Collection is a special collection.\nLM:\tYes, and especially when you’re talking about teaching and research, it is probably one of the most heavily used collections in all of the NYU special collections. And in particular, it’s challenging when you talk about the condition, because many of these materials don’t necessarily arrive to us in a stable condition because of both the nature of how they were collected, or weren’t collected and eventually came to us, and also their manufacture and materials .\nGW:\tAnd how many people do you have on staff? Or do you actually work with students to do the actual conservation work? How does that play out?\t\t\t\t[3:50]\nLM:\tSure. Currently in the lab, we’re pretty much - permanent staff, there are three of us. So, there are two Special Collections Conservators which were positions that evolved from Technician, so again, that evolution to a more specialized treatment lab. And then we, pretty much soon after I started, I started hiring IFA Conservation Center students, and that’s been a real joy and a real resource, as well, as it’s created relationships at IFA and also Museum Studies and other places. That has helped us with our program. We do get grants and other opportunities to hire people in, and so, for instance, right now I have another two conservators who are working in the lab, and a third-year Fellow from the Buffalo program for our conservation training.\nGW:\tAnd a little bit on the history of conserving the David Wojnarowicz papers here at NYU.\nLM:\tSure. I’m not sure if any pieces of David Wojnarowicz’s came down before I started working here. I’ve found no evidence of that. But I know the first item that I treated was early in my time here, and it was the wolf head, the papier mâché. And at that point, I believe the materials, the collection was here and had been mostly processed, but a lot of the material had been processed but not necessarily stabilized, because they were sort of waiting for somebody to come and help them, for me to arrive or whoever was going to get this job. So when the wolf head had come down, it was in a box filled with packing peanuts, and clearly nobody had really done too much with it, that the archivists sort of knew what was in there, left it alone, and then brought it down to the lab. And myself and actually an IFA conservation student very carefully removed the packing peanuts, which, it’s amazing how they can get into every single... everywhere. Not an ideal packing material for a variety of reasons, but partially because of the fact that it kind of breaks up and gets all into those nooks and crannies of a complex, oversized, three-dimensional sculpture.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[6:05]\nGW:\tI know the conservators have the technical skills to do material analysis, and sometimes, if it’s warranted, they do that to identify exactly what the object is made out of. At other times, they don’t have the time or the resources aren’t there. Were you able to do any technical research on the wolf head?\nLM:\tI was not. Library and archives conservation, it can be often tricky to do material research because of the fact that we don’t usually have those facilities. I do think that that is going to be changing as there is an increased interest from our users. Our users are primarily faculty and students and independent scholars in that type of analysis. That that analysis which used to really inform our work and maybe some technical art historians is now of great interest from people involved in digital humanities, that same kind of much more interest in data and material culture. So I’m hopeful we’ll get more support for that. But with that piece, we did not do any analysis. What we did, had some time for, was looking at its composition and really just trying to study how it was made, what are the materials, what was the dates. It was made with newspapers so we could get some dating material. But in terms of the exact, is it a true papier mâché or is it sort of a hybrid method, we’re not 100% sure.\nGW:\tSo, research for the future.\nLM:\tYes. Totally. Yes.\nGW:\tThere’s always that.\nLM:\tExactly.\nGW:\tAnd it’s good to be at a university for future research projects. And I can see that that would be very interesting, to identify maybe the newspapers, the headlines, the source of the papers but also the actual fabrication technique, the kind of paints that he used; the red, white, and black paint that he used on it.\nLM:\tExactly.\nGW:\tAnd do you remember what the conservation measures were? Or was it mainly archival rehousing?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[8:03]\nLM:\tI think the first thing was to get rid of these potentially harmful packing peanuts, which was more time consuming than you can imagine. Also, there was a very heavy layer of grime on there that, at that point, we went to the archivist, Ann Butler, who was then in charge of the collection, and talked with her. And she felt it was appropriate to remove that. We’ve had some different approaches with some of David Wojnarowicz’s work, which we can talk about in a bit, but I think in this situation it was felt to both obscure it and be potentially damaging to the work. And so we did some dry surface cleaning, both with light suction and brushes. I think then, as we did some photo documentation and also just examination and reporting, we noticed that it was, either it was initially a little under-engineered, or through the decay of time with all the sort of acidic cardboards and  newspapers, we were seeing that there were some major structural issues with the piece, in that this elongated nose which of course makes it very clearly iconically a wolf – it differentiates the wolf and the dog, which sometimes he plays with that imagery in his work – we could see that it was starting to collapse, which would then cause a lot of structural issues in the back. Also, there was damage to the ears, in terms of dents and bends. Our approach, which actually we revisited a few years later and actually added additional armatures, was to do kind of a preventive conservation treatment, so it was cleaning, documenting, and then building supports which are not attached to the object but support those ears. And again, we didn’t straighten out the ears either; we allowed that damage because that was felt, again in conversation with the curators who really are the ones who drive and have to approve the treatments, evidence of possible use. I mean, this is a papier mâché head; right? This was used in film, photography, performance.\t\t\t[10:00]\nGW:\tRight. So let’s definitely get back to the issue of cleaning, the issue of history of use. We’ll talk about a few different things, or categories of objects that you’ve conserved, and I think the same larger issues are going to come up.\nLM:\tThey definitely are.\nGW:\tSo maybe we can hold them and then come back to them at the end. I think they’re particularly significant with Wojnarowicz’s work. Is there anything else that you can think of that you might want future researchers to know about this piece? Or should we move on?\nLM:\tI think one of the interesting things about this piece that people may or may not know, depending upon whether they saw the piece in a performative aspect, is that the tongue element is loose and sort of moves. And that was actually very tricky because it was attached with kind of typical masking tape, most likely a rubber-based adhesive, which had dried and become detached. And we had a lot of back and forth. In the end, we did decide to reattach that, but we kept his original carrier, the top of the tape, because we felt it was important to keep all of his sort of materials that he used. But we did add a synthetic acrylic copolymer to adhere that, because we didn’t want it shifting too much during storage beyond where it was. And we thought it was important that it was partially attached but could move, that element. Which I don’t know, that’s something that like when you’re really into these pieces you discover.\nGW:\tYes. How do you document the research that you do and the treatment steps that you do, the materials that you’ve added to an object?\nLM:\tDocumentation is a subject near and dear to my heart. I think that in general, library archives conservation, because our work tends to, we tend to have this overwhelming, you know, there’s 3.5 million books in Bobst. There’s 350,000 volumes in the Fales Library. I forget how many thousands of linear feet of archives there are. And this is how it’s often spoken of. So there’s this constant pressure to produce and be very productive in a lab, that I think is a little bit different than a museum setting. But of course, we’re doing some similar work, and there’s all this, so how do we document it while still having that has been something I’ve been trying to aim for. I think one of the things is to have really good photo documentation, because photographs are so helpful to everybody and they speak very quickly. I think also, when I designed our documentation database, what I tried to do was have it be very open and not check-box-y, because I think that when you start having checkboxes, then people are not, all the stuff in their head doesn’t come out. And if you have an open-ended, kind of, describe the object, describe what you did, describe your treatment proposal process, you have an opportunity for that person to really put it out there. Of course, the disadvantage of that sometimes is how well it’s written or what have you, and you have to go back, and if you want to share this, but it gives you an opportunity to share. So I think that that’s where it is. I think sometimes it’s done better than other times because of that time pressure, that you’re like, is this really necessary to tell somebody? Like, this information is great, but if it doesn’t inform the treatment decision-making, I think sometimes it doesn’t get in there.\t\t\t\t[13:40]\nGW:\tAnd just for the sake of a future researcher, if they, say they were examining an object and they were curious about its conservation history, how would they, at Fales, request information or access information?\nLM:\tSure. This is something that is a very good question and something that I’m really working on. Their first step would be to speak to whoever the curator is in charge of that collection, and that person would have the research files and should know that. I’m also working right now with our Archival Collection Management department, which is in Technical Services. And we have a new collection management system called ArchivesSpace, and trying to find out where, in that, can we record this information. And ideally, I would like to see that pushed out to researchers in terms of the publication. We’ll see what that happens. But there is a thing called an “archival event” -- I think is what it is – and I think that that’s where we’re going to see that this is an event, that something occurred. And basically what that would say, and the same thing would be is that there is a unique number that we identify for every single treatment that comes down here. So my first treatment of David Wojnarowicz was 06-040. So that was 2006, the 40th item that came in the lab. And all of those records are deposited in the University Archives for forever, and accessible to users. I also think we’d like to come up with ways to have this information be more readily available, clickable, and what have you, but it can be tricky with the images because a lot of these images are, of course, they’re not open because they’re artist materials and we can’t just put them on the Web openly without sort of going through a certain process. But I’d like to get it better, and I think that people are really starting to become interested.\nGW:\tSo there’s a movement towards more transparency, more access, better software.\nLM:\tYes. I think so. And I think also, we might be benefitting from sort of digital humanities and the interest in just data, that this I data that maybe could be interesting to other people, and we need to get it out of the dark, as often they talk about data that’s hidden.\nDK:\tI actually just had one specific question about the wolf head before we completely moved on. I was just thinking about how in our interview with Sur Rodney Sur, he was sure that Wojnarowicz applied some kind of medium, he thought, potentially a lacquer, on top of his papier mâché work. And I know you weren’t able to do the material analysis, but just if you recall that there was something that had been applied over the newspaper pieces or not.\nLM:\tThere is a possibility that there is, but of course, in the papier mâché process it would have a coating because it would have probably that starch coating. So what I can say is that I did not notice something that was very heavy or heavily discolored, so if he was using a surface medium, it wasn’t some sort of varnish that was going to react. And again, we had a lot of surface dirt, too, so it wasn’t sticky. It didn’t discolor. But if he was using some sort of very thinned... it’s possible. Definitely the paint on there is quite shiny, but that is somewhat typical because with his aesthetic, it’s sort of spray paint that tended to be where he went from. But I don’t recall noticing anything particularly heavy; it wasn’t a heavy application.\nDK:\tOkay, that’s interesting to know. And then the photo documentation for conservation projects would be with the files that are housed in with the University Archives.\nLM:\tExactly. Yes, exactly.\nGW:\tShall we move on? Stencils?\nLM:\tStencils; lots and lots of.\nGW:\tDo you want to talk about your work with the stencils?\t\t\t\t[17:45]\nLM:\tYes. So I think, depending upon how you count them, there’s at least 55 stencils. And the majority of these came down to the lab at the end of 2014. And basically, they were found in a portfolio, kind of in the back of the archive, and they hadn’t been processed, and I think there was a note with them, because there was such a condition issue. And again, they were incredibly busy, so many collections coming in, and this just kind of got pushed to the back of a queue. And then it came up, and the curator at that time, Lisa Darms, asked us to have a look at them. And basically, it was a big group, just all stuck together, of stencils. Sometimes it would be probably twenty or thirty of them, sometimes two or three stuck, sometimes just two stuck together. And at that point, I felt like it was important, as we approached the issue with the stencils, to get all of the stencils and think about it holistically, instead of one stencil, this object, at a time, kind of more of a collection-based approach. That’s both because I wanted there to be consistency across the collection in how we treated them. I figured, if we look at all of them, we’re gonna have more interest, more information for me. [19:09] And also, it’s really economy of scale that if I’m rehousing this group that she brought down, if there’s another ten or fifteen, let’s do it all now and we can come up with a solution, or one or two solutions for all of them. So I removed a few from the collections and actually just on Friday, I brought down another box that actually had a few more in them. So we’re almost done, in 2016. [laughing]\nGW:\tWow. And, do you want to talk about the materials, and then we can talk about the conservation solutions.\nLM:\tDefinitely. What you see that’s interesting is that there’s a great consistency in the support material that he’s using. It’s Bristol board or, 20 point, generally, kind of almost between a 10 and a 20 point board. It’s white, very white. It’s hot press, so it’s shiny in its appearance. Sometimes there’s still the bar code on it from when it was purchased, so you kind of see that. They could be purchased, the typical ones that you would find in the back of a drugstore, but they could have also been purchased at an art supply shop, definitely either or. They’re not terrible quality, but they’re also not very precious quality, either. You can tell that by the bar code.\nGW:\tNot acid free.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[20:30]\nLM:\tI doubt it. But at the same time, not, I think I was surprised in the end at the consistency of it, that there was definitely an intentionality in terms of the type of board that he’s working with, I feel, like, after a while. Now, while many of them are all 22 x 28, there are many that he, assuming that it was him who did it, tore off a part of it, and there’s these fragments where there’s a stencil on a fragment or other ones that are cut. And there’s also ones that aren’t finished, which are really helpful to see. And generally, it appears that his working method often was - I think sometimes he’s also making copies, and then it’s going to be a little bit different,  because you’re tracing rather than drawing - graphite, and then probably what we would call a Sharpie, some sort of heavy marker or porous-pointed pen [unintelligible].[21:25] And then he would start to cut out the elements. And what you really see is that he had really good hand skills, in terms of his ability to cut through relatively thick board and make incredibly detailed designs, is really impressive. This is not skills that many people have, and that everyone in the lab – and these are all people who have extremely advanced hand skills, many of whom are also very, very fine book binders, which tends to be incredibly detailed work – really, really impressed with, like, wow, how did he do that? Also became apparent that the reason why they’re all sticking together is that he used some sort of spray adhesive. And in fact, on one of them, we found a reference to something which is in the documentation, it’s not in my mind right now unfortunately, but as to a brand. And that, he would spray these and then put them up against a wall, if he was doing wall, or against a piece of paper which was against the wall, which we know from other documentation was a method that he worked vertically. And because of this spray adhesive, it stays sticky for a long time. And you could definitely see patterns. And we did do a little bit of looking at them in different lights, UV in particular, and there you can kind of see the different concentration of it, where it’s lighter and where it’s darker in terms of how heavily it was sprayed. And of course because it’s sticky it’s dirty, and it’s got hair in it and muck. And it’s got footprints on it, too, which is interesting; I’m not sure where those came from. Sometimes notes, somebody’s phone number. So you really see these things in looking at the, and coming across them, we’re separating them very carefully, using our standard paper conservation techniques, sometimes having to apply heat, so we have a nice hot-air pencil here, heating tools, and going in. But then you’ve got all of these sticky stencils, and how do you deal with them? You’re also dealing with this collection in an archive environment which has very different reading room environment than necessarily a prints and drawings. So, thinking about the reading room, thinking about how these are going to be handled, thinking about the fact that I can’t put everything in a 4-ply sink mat, it was a little bit challenging. And this is where I felt really fortunate to have this relationship with the IFA Conservation Center. I hired a student named Christine Hayes, and we worked together and came up with a number of prototypes. Because the first idea of, all right, well we can deal with the stickiness by maybe we could put cellulose powder on it and document that, which would remove the stickiness. It would be very apparent to anybody, a conservator or somebody who had some good technical art history background, you could really see it easily in a microscope or what have you, and it would contain the stickiness. It wouldn’t be removing it, which to us felt wrong, but also way too time consuming when you’ve got so many.\t\t\t\t\t[24:30]\nGW:\tWhen you say “apply cellulose” are you talking about a water-borne application?\nLM:\tNo.\nGW:\tOr are you talking about a sheet?\nLM:\tIt’s actually just powder, so it’s basically just pure 100% alpha cellulose that’s in a powder form. And we use it routinely, well, pretty often in paper conservation. If you’re removing an adhesive or tape, sometimes you can take off the carrier. This is a tape that you’re not retaining, unlike the one from the wolf mask that we talked about before. And you’ve got this sticky adhesive, and you want to get it off, if you apply this powder to it, it can often give you something to grab onto. And it’s incredibly neutral; it’s not harmful in any way to the object. And so in that way, it would grab onto this adhesive, it wouldn’t remove it, but therefore it wouldn’t be sticking to things. So if we put it in a folder or put it in a Mylar sleeve, it’s going to be okay. We talked about this with a lot of different people, because it just wasn’t sitting right, even before we went to the curators, because we recognized too, the curators are busy and they need us to do this work. And it didn’t sit right. Particularly, I talked to another conservator at the Met, and it felt like, to us it seemed so obvious, but what does that mean ten, twenty years from now? What if people don’t have access to the documentation as well as I’d like them to? This important information will be gone; I’m really changing the object in a way I don’t want to. So then we decided, okay, we can’t do that. We have to keep them sticky, or sticky as long as that adhesive is sticky, because probably eventually it’ll fail. So we ended up using double-coated, silicon-coated Mylar. And then, because the versos we felt might be interesting, to kind of also see that process and the muck and the whatever, we felt that we needed to make it so that these can be seen. So when they’re in large sheets, it’s easier. But when they were small pieces or really fragile, it became harder, because all of these little cut-outs create stresses, and that as you turn the page, they want to tear and bend and break. And many were torn and broken. So we ended up putting them into Mylar pockets with this silicon coated Mylar, sometimes on both sides, because sometimes there was stickiness because of the way he would work in different directions sometimes. And then those are cornered into boards so that if somebody wants to see the verso, it’s easy. And all the kind of repair work that was done in terms of reassembling stencils where parts had broken or flipping things that had bent, we would have many reviews with Marvin Taylor and/or Lisa Darms and kind of go over all of that, and we felt really strongly that... we call them down a lot. Many times we’ll kind of come up with a general protocol when we come across this, but what we found, and actually, I find frequently in David Wojnarowicz’s works, that he does... standard protocols don’t work. All of his work is so specific and challenging in a wonderful way, that sometimes, when we had to guess too much as to where something went, we wouldn’t reattach it but we would store it with the object, adjacent, in the same Mylar pocket if it had one, so that we knew it was there.\t\t\t\t[28:00]\nGW:\tSo this question of history of use, which you brought up before, I imagine since many of them are torn, many of them were probably torn during use, you were doing repairs but were you only doing repairs when you felt that they needed them structurally in order for future researchers to handle them? Were you allowing some tears to exist?\nLM:\tYeah, it’s a good question. I think that that’s, one of the questions we asked ourself in the treatment process was, when do we think this tear or break would have happened, and what was the intention of it? And if we felt that it was a cut or an intentional, we left it. And there are situations where a stencil was used in one form and then more was subtracted and then it was used, and then more was subtracted, almost like printing. And in those situations were particularly tricky, when we would have the interiors. And in fact, I have one that I’m still working on that is in that case. And I’m struggling with how, reattaching or putting these all in proximity to each other, a) it’s going to be technically challenging, is going to be kind of reconstructing this thing as it wasn’t. But then if I store everything separately, to the user, it’s just totally deconstructed, and it doesn’t mean anything. So one option we thought of is to actually try to encapsulate these in Mylar. And of course when we’re encapsulating things in Mylar, it’s this archival polyester, and it’s being welded adjacent to the object, not on the object, so that it’s non-adhesive, and that they be layered upon each other, and we’ve done that successfully with one other piece. So that, you can sort of see both, but it’s challenging. I think most of the damage that we felt we were repairing had more to do with sort of storage and life after. Like, it felt, by the way the paint was, that this was at one time all together and that in its bundle, or when it came from the loft, or when it came from the site, somehow it got bent and kind of mixed up, but that it wasn’t intentionally damaged during the act of creation.\nGW:\tAnd can you talk about cleaning? I imagine that was not so straightforward either.\nLM:\tNot so straightforward either. I think in this situation, we were even more conservative in the cleaning. And the sense was that any loose particulate matter, so dust, would be removed. In some ways it has to be removed because it’s just going to get all over the hands of the user or the housing, but that this would be very, very light. So we did not do – just soft brush cleaning with sort of the vacuum on the side, but no sort of aggressive cleaning in any way. And we allowed all of those little bits of hairs and what have you stay right where they were, with the object.\nGW:\tAnd the footprints.\nLM:\tAnd the footprints; exactly.\nGW:\tDefinitely part of the object, at this point.\nLM:\tDefinitely.\nDK:\tAnd so just to put a fine point on some of the working methods that you were just describing throughout describing the process of dealing with these materials, we know he cut directly into these boards?\nLM:\tYes.\nDK:\tThat he may have torn – do you think he used tears as a method of extraction, or were those more?\nLM:\tI think the tearing was more like, he would have a large sheet and maybe he didn’t like what was going on on one side, and he’d tear off a bit, then he’d create, that would become a new support. But not, the creation of the stencils, they’re all hard cuts. I’m assuming he’s using some sort of X-acto blade, an Olfa knife, something like that, that allows for that. It would have to be something finer than a Stanley blade. It would be possibly an X-acto. He would have had to change it a lot though, to maintain that, so it would be curious to know what type of knife he was using.\nDK:\tAnd then, going along with the subtraction techniques, there would be iterative, in some cases, subtraction. So he would use the stencil once and then subtract more from it.\nLM:\tYes. Exactly.\nDK:\tIn order to create a layered image. And so there are the subtraction techniques, but then it sounds like there are also addition techniques, where he would join two pieces of paper?\nLM:\tI think you might see that more in the sort of finished product than in necessarily the stencils.\nDK:\tSo it would be cut from a single sheet.\nLM:\tYes. I mean, there’s moments where he’s taped and repaired some of the stencils. There’s also stencils that defy – the word stencil is hard, too, because when most people think of a stencil, they think of the work that is created with an object that has losses, and a media is put through it. But if course, it also is the tool. So it’s a tool and an image, at times, or an artwork. And many of the tools also clearly were used to create stencil images, prints, or whatever you want to call that, or installation works, but were also artworks in and of themselves. So that the stencil itself has been stenciled upon. And this is like, to me, kind of classic David Wojnarowicz, that he again defies sort of easy characterization. One of the things I was trying to do is, I do have some of the stenciled posters and other works that he made for his band or for just artworks that were made with stencils. And I said okay, two categories here: these are works that are stencil images, these are artworks; and these are tools. And I have about five of them, and I’m like, “I don’t know.” And I think, at those moments, that that’s really classic, because he’s just interested in mixing things up and trying new things, and being like, this stencil looks really interesting, and hey, could I use that as a prop in a photograph? And so we definitely have that, we have this kind of dog wolf head that he uses it in some of his photographs, but it also was used clearly, because of some of the paint that’s on it, as a stencil tool against a wall. What happened first, I have no idea, but maybe it doesn’t matter, either.\t\t[34:40]\nDK:\tAnd those were the terms you settled on, right? Was “stenciled work” and “stencil tool”?\nLM:\tStencil image and tool.\nDK:\tStencil image and stencil tool, to distinguish.\nLM:\tYes. And they’re not totally satisfactory, but they’re from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus, so when in doubt, find another authority, and then you can blame them for not being satisfactory. [laughter] So yes, now I have stencil tool, stencil image, and then stencil image/tool. [laughter]\nGW:\tOkay. Can you think of anything else about the stencils that you would want people to know?\nLM:\tI think a few other things that are interesting, and you see this in some of his other works and some of the more archival matter that I’ve seen is his often sketching out a frame, often close to a square, kind of a squarish rectangle. And sometimes there’ll be sketches that almost are just that. You can sort of see he’s done this in marker, you know, and very heavy line, and then he’s starting to come in with a little bit of pencil sketch, and then the work just didn’t. And I think that that’s an interesting, when you think about his works and how he’s thinking in this frame. I mean, I don’t know, again, I would really hesitate to say that he’s always doing that, because I think he’s just always trying different things. But there’s a certain time that -- and then kind of goes with these comics that I’ve seen in his works, and obviously his film work and photography. That’s one thing. I think also just like how delicate a lot of this work is. The stencils really, there’s the iconography that I think many of us who are familiar with his work know: the houses, the camo, the fighting men, dreaming or falling man, all that. But then there’s also all of these animals, these fish and flying fish, that kind of goes back to a lot of his interests that are great. So yeah, no, the stencils are wonderful.\nGW:\tOkay. There’s one other piece that I want to talk about, the coffin piece, but before we get to that, are there other categories of works that you’ve conserved, or have we pretty much covered?\nLM:\tWe’ve worked on his photographs and they’re interesting. I think he was a wonderful photographer. I think that you see some of his experimentation in the darkroom. And I think that the prints that ended up here were clearly ones that were kind of considered the archival copies, and also sometimes ones that he was probably not finished, you know, sort of test prints. And you see that. You see the sort of sloppiness with some of the experimentation. You also can kind of see when I know some other people printed some of his images, and you sort of see the contrast with them. But those are interesting, to see some of his working methods and in the darkroom, it feels like he was in the darkroom learning how to do this, which was new skills for him kind of in the middle of his career, when he really started trying to do that, because before he had access to a darkroom he was having everything printed. I think that his journals, I worked on only in the sense that when they were digitized we went through them to make sure that they would be prepared for digitization. And my approach really there was that, I understand we want digitization to be very complete, but to me it was very important that we preserve these as they are, and this is not a moment to be aggressive at all. And I think that that was heard very much, and I think that Marvin and Lisa and I were all on page with that. There was sometimes some sticky residue from tapes in there that were holding pages together. That was pretty straightforward.\nGW:\tWhat strikes me is the advantage of the conservator to be able to just really get in -\nLM:\tYes.\nGW:\tAnd get your hands on these objects and look at them under the microscope and work with them. And the ability to just then think about what was he doing, what materials was he using, what has their history been.\nLM:\tRight.\nGW:\tAnd you really only get that from working with them, especially with an artist’s archive.\nLM:\tYes.\nGW:\tAs opposed to maybe in a museum collection, you are working with materials that are half finished or even experiments that were never meant to be finished.\t\t[39:20]\nLM:\tRight. Exactly. I mean, I think that that’s the thing too with these stencils is that we’ve got everything from ones that were so heavily used that their edges – he probably rejected them and made a new one. Like, there’s many houses on fire. I think that’s a whole thing, that folks from PPOW talk about that they would make new ones all the time, because you want to keep those images crisp. And if you’re spraying them a lot, they’re going to get soft. Your flames are going to be a little not as dramatic.\nGW:\tFuzzy flames.\nLM:\tWell, it’s got this lightning effect; right? The flames, and I think that that’s really important, I mean, I would assume. One other piece, there’s this letter he wrote to Dennis Cooper, and a photo collage, and that was interesting because I worked on that soon after I had started. And I think they had had a student write a paper about it. I think it might have been an IFA art history student, for a class. And it was interesting to read their approach. And a lot of these photos, they’re really wonderful photographs, and they’re very much fine art, important photographs. But he’s kind of taped them together with this sort of very poor quality tape. And I think the instinct of that person doing it was to remove the tape; and this was a conversation we had. And we, myself working with the archivists, we felt that like, while yes, the tape is going to damage it; it’s going to cause yellowing. And yes, the appreciation of those individual photographs is impacted, that the fact that he created this letter and he made this collage with this tape is much more important than each individual photograph. And I think that being in an archival environment, library environment, that’s what makes those decisions pretty straightforward, that we have them. But then of course, it’s the trick of, with tape, you know, it’s just like the stickiness on the back, we have to sort of preserve that, but then there’s problems with it because tape, most tapes, not all tape, the adhesive will creep out underneath the carrier over time and then will stick to things around it. So it’s a matter of like, how do you mitigate that damage very carefully, also while not scratching the photographs, and making sure, and then monitoring it over time. But that was something that was fun. And it had been stored folded in an envelope, and then this was the other issue, where we had to balance use versus – you know, in some ways, there’s a part of me that wants to preserve it kind of folded in that envelope as it was. Right? But then, the other part recognizes that people are going to need to use this. And we’re a busy reading room, and that if this is going to be pulled out frequently, then you’re going to have a lot of damage across those folds, and you’re going to have a lot of loss, and then the object is going to really start to look and feel different. And it did because of course it was not a heavily used object. It’s not something that was full of creases and things we already had. So we made the decision to store it flat. So there’s a moment when we did alter sort of format, but because we had to understand the context of the collection where it was decided to be deposited, and we want to say yes to users. So that’s just one other object.\nGW:\tVery interesting.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[42:45]\nDK:\tI have two other specific questions about materials and about stencils and photographs, before we move on to the final project I know we want to talk about. The stencil, so, it was a consistent use of this similar or the same type of paperboard?\nLM:\tYes, exactly.\nDK:\tThere weren’t any outliers in terms of support or paint?\nLM:\tNo, not really. They’re pretty consistent. Once in a while in the sort of more images or finished artworks, there’d be some really fine art paper. And that’s a little bit surprising. You don’t see a lot of very, very fine art paper. You see more of the shiny Bristol board. But I do think that he was very intentional in his picking of his materials. I got a little bit of a sense of that too from Cynthia Carr’s book where sort of he knew folks who were working at New York Central and, you know, that, he wasn’t precious. He wasn’t trying to get this nice expensive stuff, but he was very thoughtful. It was a different type of process. It wasn’t like, what’s the best; it was like, what’s the best for my purposes?\nDK:\tAnd then in terms of the experimentation in the darkroom, if there were particular processes you saw, just since you’ve looked a lot of the photograph collection. Are there sort of photograms? It looked like there was maybe some experimentation with chemicals in the darkroom?\nLM:\tYes, there’s some of that. And there’s like solarized prints, and that kind of, that’s where you sort of see, and that’s sometimes where you see that like he’s got some processing issues in terms of, it looks like either it’s just there’s a lot of chemical splash on the verso, or in the highlights you’re seeing some yellowing which, I mean, I’m not a photo conservator definitely by training, but in my understanding, might show that some developer hasn’t been washed out. There might be... it wasn’t really properly fixed and processed. But again, these might have been quick test prints. I mean, that’s very common. You make the print, and then you say, okay, am I going to do this, or am I going to also have – if he was – I’ve heard talk – I’ve heard that he’d worked with some master printers. He might be like, okay, I’m going to print this out; what does this look like as an 8x10, and do I want to? But again, that’s just my projection onto that.\nDK:\tOkay. So those were the types of experiments that you saw.\nLM:\tYes, and all of the photographs in that group were just developed out silver gelatin photographs. There are Photostats in the collection, but those would have been done commercially. And that tends to be either photo reproductions of his own work or some sort of newspaper image that he was interested in, some sort of found material, because we know he incorporated that text.\nGW:\tOkay, well, why don’t we move on to the coffin piece, or at least that’s what I call it.\nLM:\tYes, yes.\nGW:\tWhat do you call it?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[45:55]\nLM:\tYou know, it’s such a complicated piece, and it doesn’t have a name, like so many of David Wojnarowicz’s materials that we have, partially because they aren’t finished artworks, they don’t necessarily have titles. This work might be a finished artwork; we don’t know. But what we named it in the end was Coffin, I think, With Human Remains, Trinkets, and Textiles. I might have that wrong, but basically, we tried to describe what the main components of this object are, which, it is a coffin that has been painted, and recently treated by a student at the IFA Conservation Center because there was some water damage and loss to it. And inside the coffin is the human remains of most likely a six-year-old girl, which has been wrapped in a heavy woven blanket which was stenciled, most likely by David Wojnarowicz. It’s not an image I’m familiar with, but the technique and the type of image is consistent with his work. And some other different fabrics, and an old pink towel, and lots of trinkets that were everything from little vials of something, or sometimes I think they were empty vials; American flags, keychains, different kind of stuff. Jewelry that if you’re familiar with David Wojnarowicz’ Magic Box or some of the other material, because I have rehoused a lot of his other what they call “source material” I’m very familiar with. You know, watch parts, again, jewelry or beads, just funny little knick-knacks, mementos.\nGW:\tOkay. Well, let’s, I do want to talk about the conservation, but I think we can’t get around talking about the first material you mentioned, human remains. So could you tell us a little bit about that and what concerns you have, the Library has, NYU has, with having human remains in its archival collection?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[48:15]\nLM:\tSure. I think that the fact that we had human remains was very much, it was a surprise to me, but then, the collection is so vast that I don’t know it all. It’s a really large and complex collection. And it was described in the finding aids as “skeleton” which is in some ways accurate, because it is a skeleton. But of course, if you know David Wojnarowicz’s work, you will know that there are so many skeletons in terms of imagery and plastic skeletons. And there’s a Greer Lankton piece which is also described as a skeleton, when in fact it’s like a baked clay kind of two-headed body, but it’s entitled “Skeleton.” So again, sometimes, these descriptions, or maybe we all don’t want to recognize that we had this human remains there too, you know; who knows. But when it came to our attention, which was during the process of it being loaned, the coffin itself, the outside of it, so all of these other things are inside the coffin, to the IFA Conservation Center, it was a shock to me personally because I didn’t think when I was going to be a paper conservator I’d be coming across human remains. And I had never really thought about those issues in the way that many of my objects conservator colleagues at other institutions do and must. If you go on archeology digs you don’t know what you’re going to find, and you’re going to have to think about these things. And there’s a body of literature that surrounds it. And then also, the human remains are dressed up in a little dress, and there’s coins in the eyes, which of course helped with dating the piece. And it’s all wrapped, kind of shrouded; it’s almost like this burial. Which, again, would feel very consistent. I can’t remember the exact dates of the coins but I think they’re ’89 to ’90. So if you think about what’s going on in his work, a really powerful piece and very much feels like one of his pieces. And also then, the student who was working on the coffin did some archival research which was great, because as many things do, this popped up in the midst of many other deadlines, and discovered that there’s many photographs of this human remains dressed up and there with the eyes not with the coins, earlier. And basically, it looks like we think that it came from Paris, one of his trips to Paris, probably in the ‘80s. And when we first saw, to kind of backtrack, when I was first aware of the human remains, I really didn’t know how to deal with it. Because part of me was also: This is an artwork. It had been removed from the coffin. Unfortunately, it wasn’t documented when it was taken out, and some of the material we felt might have been disassociated. Marvin knew some information about it, but obviously it would have been better to have it be photo-documented. But that isn’t what happened. And I thought, okay, what do I do now? And I think, this is where I’m really lucky to work at a university, and to have actually studied some archeology in undergraduate. So I thought, I need to call what I would have called a physical anthropologist, now it’s a bio-anthropologist. And Professor Harrison, who is the chair of the Anthropology Department, answered the phone and said, “I’m coming over.” And he was over in ten minutes. And he was incredibly helpful. And again, that kind of collaboration with other professions is so important, and a big of what you do when you are a conservator is understanding who you need to talk to about what. And he was the right person at that time. So he identified that it was human remains, that it wasn’t a model, that it had been prepared, so it was very much on the market. This was not something he dug up or something; it was sold. Most likely in Paris. He explained to us the routes in the trafficking of human remains and how, and the various things that have happened since the late ‘80s that have sort of slowed down that market. He also said it was very unusual to see a child skeleton. He thinks that most likely it was a child who died sometime in the ‘80s, so it’s not an older skeleton; it would have been pretty contemporary. And he said that that’s unusual. Then it was sort of, well what do we do? And what was interesting was he spoke very much from his point of view and his profession and his ethics. And his point of view was like, this should not be dressed up. We don’t dress up human remains and we don’t really like to have them in museums or libraries. But you are legally allowed to have this here. I would ask that you describe it properly. And that he also – but you have to decide according to your set of ethics. This is my thing. If you do decide you don’t want it, he was very clear that they would take it, but not in the state that it was. They would not take it dressed, and they would not keep the coins in the eyes. They would take it as a human remain. It would become a part of their study collection, and it would be treated there. And I think that, I mean, this is a situation where I needed to learn a lot as a conservator, and also just for myself, about human remains and their place in collections. But the decision what to do with it was fundamentally the custodians, which would be Fales. And their decision to keep the object, I agree with wholly. If it was my decision, I would be there, because I think that there’s no other satisfactory answer. I also think that this is a work of art, and while it may be difficult for many people to sort of confront that this is a human being’s remains in there, it is what it is. And I think that a lot of David Wojnarowicz’s work for many people is hard to confront, and it is very emotional and raw and not easy. One of the most interesting things approaching it is how – and maybe this is true for some of David Wojnarowicz’s other work, is how people have such different responses to these human remains. Some people were very upset by it, and then other people were very, like, ‘Oh, I used to work at this other museum; they had lots of human remains.’ And that’s an interesting thing there. So in the end, what we did was, when the coffin, the treatment was completed, very successfully, I might add, we first photographed every element of the installation or the object. And the hardest thing was sort of the mementos and trinkets, to know exactly where they should go. And we ended up sort of treating them almost like archeological objects, which is interesting, in a way, because it was almost like we were doing this tagging and bagging, just like in a dig. You know? And we ended up putting her right back into the box in the way that we believed that David Wojnarowicz did. So we wrapped her in the blanket which has this image of sort of the shackled person, but these large arms that kind of envelope her. Right? And then the other things. And then the trinkets and materials, we sort of put more at her feet together in one thing, because we didn’t feel satisfactory that if we were sort of placing it here and there, it felt a little too reconstructed. I think that if this piece was going to be exhibited in some way, that would be a decision for the curator. But of course, it’s a closed coffin. So, I mean, is it a work of art, or is it sort of – I’m not sure. Is this something that you would exhibit in some sort of way because she’s of course completely clothed, covered. I mean, it’s more of a performative piece. It’s more the end of a performative piece, I would think, although there’s no evidence that this was performed.\nGW:\tLet me interrupt. First of all, thank you for that. We will get on to the conservation project, but thank you for that professional reaction which was obviously a very emotional reaction as well.\nLM:\tYes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[56:40]\nGW:\tI think it’s very open and honest of you and it will be very helpful to future researchers, and I imagine there will be future researchers who want to learn more about this work. And I’d like to just mention at this point that Diana Kamin and I, but mainly Diana, interviewed Sur Rodney Sur, who also mentioned the three skeletons that David Wojnarowicz had purchased. And so, I won’t repeat all of that because it’s in the interview with Sur Rodney Sur. But thank you for that.\nDK:\tCan I just add onto that because, so, we know that he purchased from a few sources from Paris and had shipped to him in 1985, but those were used that year in two different installations in which he covered them with, in some cases, actual pig’s blood, paint, I think some were collaged over. So my question with this, do you think it’s possible, having examined it, that this is a cleaned version of a piece that had previously – is it possible that it could be the same skeleton? Because given the material that was applied to it, I have been wondering whether they could be the same.\nLM:\tI mean, it’s very clean. So, my feeling would be that – and bone is pretty porous; right? So, I don’t know. It’s hard to know. Yes, of course, you can clean bone again, but would he have gone to that extreme, to like – we definitely did not see or observe or document any paint residue or anything like that. And we were pretty –\nGW:\tAnd it could also be, Sur Rodney Sur was also trying to remember, and it could have been the other skeletons that had been covered with materials.\nLM:\tSure. Did he mention a child?\nDK:\tThere were two adult and one child that were used in two installations in 1985, and those were what he was talking about. And Richard Kern also mentioned, he was excited about, I just bought this family of skeletons in Paris; they were talking about it in 1985. Maybe there was an additional child skeleton from that shipment. It’s not ruled out from what they’ve described. But what was used in those two installations and what these two interviewees recalled was two adults one child.\nLM:\tI mean, it’s possible. And especially, I don’t know if there’s any documentation of that, it’s also possible that the child was not as inflected with the blood and the paint, perhaps. I’m not sure what he was doing in that.\nGW:\tWell, this is certainly material for future research.\nLM:\tYes, people need to get to work on that.\nGW:\tFor any future researchers that are listening, we would welcome, I think, if we could find photographs, more photographs of the installation or more documentation. And it may even be in the David Wojnarowicz papers and we just haven’t discovered them yet.\nLM:\tExactly. There is so much in there to explore.\nDK:\tAnd then I just had one more question with that.\nLM:\tSure.\nDK:\tBecause there was a coffin and skeleton included in a 1989 installation at the New Museum.\nLM:\tOkay.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1:00:20]\nDK:\tAnd I was wondering if that was identified or explored in the course of your research.\nLM:\tI’m not familiar, but again, Joy Bloser was the one who really kind of did that research. My approach to it more felt like, a lot of the research that I perform here is often directly related to my decision-making. And I thought it was important, the work that Joy is doing, to sort of contextualize and to understand it there. But I think that what I was really trying to do in a lot of my discussions was just how do we approach this in terms of keeping this here, and how do we serve this? Because we can’t serve this object, because it’s fragile, number one, and also it’s just going to continue to sort of be more and more disassociated. And so it was really focusing on like how are we going to document this in terms of our photography. And that was my sort of, rather than the sort of history of the object. But once I knew it was a human remain, then I was like, okay, we have a human remain. Are we going to keep this? Yes, we’re going to keep this. And how do we do this in a way that is sensitive to the human remain and to David Wojnarowicz’s work and also sensitive to the people who are reporting to me and are collaborating with me and making sure everyone is sort of okay with this. Which, some people aren’t, and you have to be aware of that. Like, am I using this in the Reading Room? Am I, you know? That was sort of my approach. And sort of like, I feel like the research and the thinking I did was around that more than that. But definitely, I think that that’s something that needs to be looked at. And I think too skeletons are really a major part of his work, in terms of both the image of the skeleton and on also this use of the human remains is clearly something, you know. But it was a different time, too. I mean, human remains were sold openly in New York City up to not too long ago. But now, you can still buy them, but it’s a little different. Like, our culture is shifting.\nGW:\tI think you’re absolutely right. We’re much more sensitive to the presence of human remains in collections than we were twenty years ago.\nLM:\tYes.\nGW:\tAnd that’s because a whole lot of cultural shifts that we’ve been experiencing.\nLM:\tYes. Sure.\nGW:\tWell, maybe we should move on. If you could talk a little bit more about the actual conservation. I realize that Joy Bloser, the conservation student at the IFA, did the research, but you worked closely with her, and we will hopefully attach your report, her report, to the information resource so they’ll be there. But maybe you could just walk us through her approach and what she did.\t\t\t\t\t\t[1:03:10]\nLM:\tHer approach with the coffin was supervised by another conservator, an objects conservator, so I won’t speak too much about that, because actually it was dealing with the painted surface. But primarily the issue was it had suffered water damage at some point after he had painted it, and there was loss and there was some blistering of the paint, which she consolidated, and they did some. What we did in terms of, and Joy collaborated with us on this, Joy, Lou Di Gennaro who is one of the Special Collections conservators, and I is we really, our conservation approach was documentation. So we just documented everything. There was a few places where the preparation of the human remain had gotten loose in terms of in the sort of mishandling of it initially. And in those situations, we put it back and it was quite straightforward in terms of realigning pins and this. But it was just a matter of again, it’s sort of that archaeological approach of, we’re going to just photograph every single thing, we’re going to sort of give it an ID number, and then we’re going to put it back together. We made a decision not to clean it. It wasn’t particularly dirty, but we didn’t take out the textiles and vacuum them in a way that I would when I get a collection from the Spanish Civil War, which is one of my other collections that I take care of. But textiles and uniforms, my first instinct is going to be, look for pests, freeze it if I have to, and then vacuum it. That wasn’t – I feel when I’m approaching contemporary art, it’s very different. We’re not necessarily doing that. We’re allowing the objects to be, unless we see evidence of pest damage, which we didn’t. So in that sense, and then in the housing outside of that was, we had another box built for it, and had it really labeled on the outside as to what it is. And then when we reassembled the object, we did basically very staged photographs so that you had the coffin empty, you had the coffin with the first fabric, you had the coffin with the next fabric, so it layers up. So that if you’re a researcher and you’re really interested in this piece, you can get a sense of all of the components without actually using it. And that was sort of my goal as I work for NYU Libraries which is the faculty and the staff, and I need to facilitate research. So I can’t just say, you know, like, no, you can’t see it. I need to find a way that will be satisfactory.\nGW:\tAnd now it’s clearly labeled, so there won’t be any surprises when somebody opens up the coffin lid and finds a skeleton.\nLM:\tExactly. You know, that’s an interesting thing, too, is that we all went to this assumption that it wasn’t a real skeleton, which of course is interesting. Avoidance, you know.\nGW:\tOkay, well, thank you, for that. I just want to ask you – we’re getting towards the end – are there any further thoughts you have about how conservators or technical researchers should approach materials by David Wojnarowicz?\t\t\t\t[1:06:15]\nLM:\tYeah, I mean,\nGW:\tWe’ve already talked about cleaning,\nLM:\tRight.\nGW:\tAnd recognizing history of use.\nLM:\tYes, exactly. And I think that that one might be very different with his works that were intended for market, you might have a different – because when it’s in the archive, its purpose is different than when it’s in a museum or in a private collector’s environment and we have to recognize those different purposes. I think one of – there have been times where I really felt – all right. There’s a – in so many ways he was not an artist in that trained sense, but in so many other ways he was. Okay, yes, he didn’t go to the art school, and he learned it here and there, and in some ways you want to sort of have him be like, oh, he just would work on anything. And in so many periods of his life, he was obviously impoverished and money was a great concern. And there is evidence of that, but in other ways, I feel like he was very particular about his work and he was very intentional about his work, and very skilled. And I think that is really important to recognize. And perhaps that that instinct to initially kind of just observe the footprints and the sort of picture of him in the loft and it’s this big mess, and then the sort of his also biography and to go to this like, this is just this super creative brilliant guy who’s just doing this stuff, is romanticizing it and not recognizing the skill and thought that he was putting into creating these visual works. That’s something I see. There’s an intentionality; there’s a consistency. But then, at the same time as that there’s a consistency, he’s just incredibly creative, and that’s where your protocols, you’re not going to apply one thing to everything, whether it’s calling it a particular category or not. He wasn’t interested in that. He was just always pushing on the edges, both himself, I think, but also the works. What can this do? What can this not do? And while he definitely had skill and cared very much about his work, we know that, he also wasn’t precious, and that’s where you sort of see the ripped paper and like, okay, I’ll just use this corner and I’ll redo this. Yeah.\nGW:\tThese are every interesting insights from a conservator who has worked so intimately with his work, that I find this fascinating that, right; he didn’t go through standard MFA training, but he was an incredibly creative expressive person.\nLM:\tRight. Yes.\nGW:\tAnd he did care about his materials, he wanted to activate these materials. And we can’t forget that he was a political activist as well, and that much of his art is infused with that.\nLM:\tRight. Yes. And of course it’s a really amazing, and I’m a really lucky person to be able to work on his materials. But they’re also, they’re very powerful. I think another thing too is, when you think about his intentionality, about how his materials were displayed, and his message, especially when you’re looking at the last few years of his life where a lot of, you know, there’s this urgency of expression. There’s also this urgency of what’s going on, you know. Everyone is dying around him, and he knows he’s going to die, and his art is often addressing death. And we just talked about the human remains; right? That you see as much as there’s, you feel the energy in terms of the output, and you look at the kind of archives, but the same like very much intentionality that is there. And I just went through some archival materials from the later part of his life, and there’s tons of drawings of installation rooms, and I also just love the fact that he wrote on the bottom of it that these were to be mounted on 4-ply museum board. And to a conservator, that feels like something that I would write to my curator to say, okay, well, we need to get some 4-ply museum board. Because museum board is a very specific product. It’s kind of even copyrighted. And 4-ply board, he wants it to have a certain thickness. He’s not saying, “Mount it to board.” And I think that is important, that as much as the work may sometimes feel there’s all this surface dirt and little bit things are torn and whatever, there’s very much a plan there without a preciousness.\nGW:\tInteresting. Okay, well, we thank you for this. And is there anything else that just comes to mind that you would like people to know? We’ve been pretty thorough here.\nLM:\tI think so.\nGW:\tI always like to ask one last time.\nLM:\tI just think it’s a really amazing archive that we have here, I mean, all the Downtown artists, but particularly David Wojnarowicz’s collection or his papers, MS 092. And I would just encourage people to dive into them and to do research. I think that obviously, just about his work, his thoughts, his writing is also fantastic, and there’s room for exploration there, but also just the whole downtown, what was going on downtown and the history of AIDS activism and activism in general. There’s a lot in there, so, people need to get in, because it’s here for you.\nGW:\tGreat. All right. Well, on that note, thank you very much for your time.\nLM:\tThank you both so much.\nEND at 1:12:07\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_Text_with_Laura_McCann_by_Glenn_Wharton_and_Diana_Kamin_on_12-08-2016&oldid=4175\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterview Text\nThis page was last modified on 16 April 2017, at 21:59.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}

I’m Glenn Wharton, here with Marvin Taylor and Marguerite Van Cook and James Romberger. We’re here to discuss their knowledge of David Wojnarowicz. Why don’t we get started by discussing your gallery, Ground Zero. Perhaps you could just tell us a little bit about the history of the gallery, and then how you worked with David at the gallery.\nJR: When Marguerite had a rehearsal studio on Avenue A and 11th Street, right next to Anton Van Dalen’s studio, when I met Marguerite she had the space. And one of the early times just after I met Marguerite she said, “Oh, have a walk around the corner and go look at this little gallery and maybe show them your work,” because I had some small pastel drawings. So I walked around the corner with my roll of stuff, and there was Civilian Warfare,and it was very early on in their history and I – you had said, “Speak to Dean,” I think. But it was Greer Lankton’s show in there, which blew my mind. And there was a guy in there, and he’s like this tall, lanky guy. And I said, “Is Dean here?” And he goes, No, he’s not here.” And he was like hacking away at this sort of like totem pole thing. He had this real deep, grumbly voice, and he’s like, “Dean’s not here.” I said, “Well, I wanted to show him this work.” He goes, “Well I’ll look at it.” And so I rolled all of these things out, and he was, like, very positive. He was like, “Yeah, Dean should give you a show,” like right away. And I did actually go back when Dean was there, and he said, “Oh yeah, we’re going to give you a show,” but I actually never did it. It was, like, I could have shown at Civilian, but I just didn’t.\nVC: That was David, just to add.\nJR: But it was David, and that was my first introduction to him. However, I had actually seen his work earlier, when I went with a girlfriend I had before I even met Marguerite, went to the opening of the, it was like an opening and closing of the Pier. So I remember, it was like an event; everybody’s like, you know, champagne glasses and high heels in this rubble. And I remember David’s mural in there with the cow, and that comic strip that he did on there. It actually struck me, the power of that particular work, even as raw as it was. It was like obviously somebody that had a potent kind of voice already.\nGW: Well, you know, maybe we should go back. Did you actually ever have a gallery before?\nJR: No, that was our first gallery. What happened was, we did a show called The Acid Test at this little gallery. We started living together, and we\nVC: We were doing curations,\nJR: We did early shows at Danceteria.\nVC: And we had decided to just call ourselves Ground Zero, and we had a comic book of the same name that we were working on, which we were placing in different magazines in different places. And Ground Zero seemed to be an appropriate name for the gallery, being as we felt that we were the epicenter of something that was both destructive and productive: New York.\nJR: I mean, what happened was, we did that Acid show, and we did club shows, and then we did, we had this gossip columnist crashing with us for a little while, Tony Heiberg that wrote for the East Village Eye. And I had seen this little gallery, Sensory Evolution. I went, “Oh, what a cool name.” And I was talking to Marguerite while Tony was in earshot, and he said, “We should do and Acid show in Sensory Evolution.” Because it was, like, the right name. Well then Tony printed it in his gossip column that we were going to do a show. [laughter] And actually, the guy that ran it had already kind of blown me off. I tried to show him work and he didn’t care to even look at it. And I was kind of like, “Whatever.” But then, I ran into him on the street and he goes, “Oh, I saw the gossip column; you guys can do that for one night.” So we put the show up, and actually, we put Dean, Dean Savard actually was a painter himself, and we asked him for a piece for the show. And so when we had this fantastic opening – it kind of entered into legend because Martin Wong took too much acid at the show, and like, gave away his semaphore paintings. This is a well known story. Barry had to go buy them back from the junkies on Avenue B. But, after the show, Dean was so thrilled that we had put him in this show – and nobody else had ever asked him to be in a show, in all this time. And so he was thrilled to death to be in the show, and he said, “We’re moving Civilian Warfare to this new improved space.” And he knew that we were actually looking for a place to live. He goes, “You guys can have my old gallery.” So we actually moved into there with the intention of just living there.\nVC: He gave us the keys at 3:00 in the morning. [laughter] __[4:50]\nJR: And we were like living in the back. We kind of went, “You know what? Since we’re living here, we might as well just open the front for a gallery.” So we just opened it up, and I did a little show of my own stuff.\nGW: Could you describe the space?\nJR: A very tiny little\nVC: It’s a long, narrow space, with a turquoise painted front, which, it had David’s banner up on the\nJR: Oh, and it had his stencils on the window, of the burning house.\nVC: And we liked the stencils, and so we added to them, which was, so, there was a sense of collaboration. And yeah, we put up a curtain at the back. And this long, narrow space, we just used for a gallery. And at some point, Dean had not paid the electric bill, and the people upstairs ran the line down for us.\nJR: We had an extension cord running down from upstairs. [laughter]\nVC: I think, you know, it’s sort of speaking to the zeitgeist of the galleries. Even though we did the show at Sensory Evolution, Stephen Styles didn’t want to look at James’s slides, and different to the situation at Civilian Warfare, whose name we also liked, that, one, David was sitting in the middle of a gallery show hacking away on a piece of wood. So there was nothing sacrosanct about the gallery environment. Two, when James walked in, they just happily unrolled the work on the floor. And three, that Dean was just so willing to give us the keys when he left. [laughter]\nGW: It sounds like you’re not ordinary curators here, that you were working with artists in new ways or very different ways than the standard curator would.\nVC: Yes, I think that’s fair to say.\nJR: Well, when we were doing the Danceteria things, we’d have to do – one of the first shows we did was called The East Village Look Again. It was like another show they had done previously, the year before, I guess. But when we did it, we actually went around to every single – there was like a hundred galleries, so we went to each one and asked them for a piece to put in the show. And in this way we actually got to know almost everybody in the scene very, very quickly. And we had already lived in the neighborhood for a while, but we weren’t really involved in that scene. Marguerite was in rock and roll, and\nVC: And when a few people wouldn’t let us have pieces, which again, sort of, you know, these are very long-term relationships that have stayed in place – you didn’t give us a piece for that show 30 years ago, you’re not allowed, not in the same zeitgeist, mindset, that we’re in. But, so, at that point, we invited some curators to also curate into this show, so it became the most – Carlo [McCormick] wrote about it -- overly democratic show in the world. [laughing]\nJR: Robert Costa curated a show at our place, and he wrote a brilliant press release, which actually, when he sent it out, Grace Glueck from the Times got it and loved it, just the idea of it. She rode down on her bicycle and then wrote a review of our very first show in our gallery and put in on the front of the Sunday Arts and Leisure. Which was like __. [7:50] And our friend Calvin’s [Reid] piece from the show was the image on the front of the Sunday Times. It was like, What?! But also then I did a show of my own, and actually, David – I didn’t know David that well, but he came to my first show and brought Peter Hujar with him. And I was thrilled, because I had actually, before I even got to New York, I found that book of Peter’s, and I went, ‘This guy is, like, the greatest living photographer’ for the Portraits in Life and Death, my mind was blown. So when David brought him, I was like, ‘Oh my god, he brought Peter Hujar!’ I was just thrilled to death.\nGW: So curators might come in and co-curate. Did artists also sort of curate? Did they work with other artists?\nVC: No. A bit. We were very\nJR: We let Peggy __ do one and Robert Costa do one.\nVC: Oh, you’re right, we let Peggy Cyphers curate a show.\nJR: That was about it for that.\nVC: But mainly, we worked with artists to the extent that – so, going to the idea of the gallery, that we were very keen to have a space that would allow for installation work, because there wasn’t anywhere to do it. There were the clubs, but to have it in a gallery situation, and also just, I wanted to offer people the opportunity to really push the work to the most farther limit that they had thought possible, And a lot of times our artists would be concerned that we were going to say no. And of course, [laughing] we always said, “No, no, no; you’re not going far enough. Please go a little farther.” So, one of our early shows at the Civilian Warfare space was this guy Robert Parker, who put a ladder, who actually put a campfire in the middle of the gallery. We seem to have had a lot of fire in the gallery, now that I think about it. And so this big wooden structure, and he was into metalwork and forges, but he was also a conceptualist. And he put coal around the whole edges of the gallery.\nJR: Right; he forged those huge railroad spikes and hammered them in the wall with like red paint coming out, looking like they were bleeding into like a stigmata on the wall.\nVC: Yes. So it was a very – I don’t know what , you know – so it was very interesting because\nJR: I think it was your bent more. Marguerite is much more versed in conceptual art than I am. I mean, I may be more pragmatic in terms of materials, like, I want people to draw or whatever, but we totally wanted to push people in terms of content matter and the idea of Ground Zero, like, this is the place where people should do the most intense work. But then Marguerite also would very much push them to transform the space to be a site-specific thing reflecting the most pure statement they could make and not necessarily to sell. We did a lot of kind of unsaleable installations.\nVC: And it was an interesting thing that some people, some artists, responded well to that. And others found it very difficult to move from a piece of wall art. And there was a – we had a – the idea -- James always gets upset about his own work going into galleries and being on the wall for a limited audience, but then going to somebody’s home even before anybody’s even seen it. So we wanted to move away somewhat also from that sort of idea of the prestige of the wall piece, but I also wanted it very much to be, to reexamine actually what that means, to create a piece of work. So, we had become quite close to David at a certain point, and he was obviously the ideal character to do that. And he was feeling constrained. He had been showing I think with Gracie [Mansion] at that point.\nJR: They were very much trying to make him do -- his dealers wanted him to do saleable wall pieces. And that’s their focus because that’s what they’re in business for, and they’re spending a lot of money. At that time, there was like people spending a lot of money for full-page ads in ArtForum or whatever, and it’s a substantial. The rent started going up, especially with the advent of these kind of neo-geo guys. The gentrification of the East Village had gotten to the point where the storefronts were really getting much more expensive. The galleries were expanding, getting bigger, like Dean moving to a bigger Civilian Warfare. All of a sudden, now he’s got this overhead, and the advertising, and all this stuff going on. It wasn’t really Dean trying to make him more commercial. I think they actually were gone by that time. I think it was when he was starting to do a deal with Gracie a little bit.\nVC: Yeah.\nGW: And so maybe you could tell us s little more about your early relationship with David and how you discussed and negotiated works that you would install in the gallery.\nJR: What happened is, he came in when Marguerite was pregnant and he’d heard that we were broke in the back with no electricity, and he gave Marguerite a check for like, a substantial chunk of money. He said, “Oh, I just did an auction for Life Café.\nVC: Well, it was substantial to us.\nJR: And then goes, “They gave me half the money.” He says, “I’m giving money to a café.” He goes, “I heard you guys __.” [13:10] He just gave us the half of the money. And I was like, oh my god. I gave him painting for that.\nVC: This is also based on, well one, I was pregnant, and two, we were doing this completely – this gallery could not possibly make any money. [laughing] So he was there to support that, as well. But we had moved around the corner. Unfortunately Dean’s relationship with the landlord had completely disintegrated and we couldn’t actually continue to pay the rent.\nJR: It was through his lease.\nVC: Yeah, we couldn’t. So that sort of fell apart. So we moved around the corner into a much nicer space on Thompkins Square Park and Tenth Street.\nJR: But that wasn’t – he gave us the money when we were still in the Civilian __\nVC: Yes, that was early, early on.\nJR: It’s strange because I gave him a painting, I felt so intense, like, he gave us this money. So I gave him a painting I did of __[13:57] and I think it must be somewhere here in the collection, although I’m not seeing it listed.\nGW: Well what were his thoughts about exhibiting his works? Did you work to sort of push him a little bit further as well?\nJR: The first piece he gave us was actually for the Acid show, and that was a collaboration with Marion.\nVC: Right. With Kikki Smith?\nJR: That thing with the upside-down photo.\nVC: That was the three of them.\nJR: Well, it was Marions’ photo of Kikki Smith with a skeleton overlaid on the face, and that was under a little doorway with a fence on it. But then there was another thing that was like a hand cutting meat with a map. So that was the first piece we showed.\nMT: We have a slide of that.\nVC: And our first curations very often were, we covered the walls underneath. So they were already hanging on work. So there was already this energy happening.\nJR: It was your installation really that we hung the work on top of, for that show.\nVC: But people did pieces.\nJR: But then when we did move around the corner to Tenth Street and we were like: Okay, now we’re going to do a formal year, and we had a backer that was helping us pay the rent. And then David said, “I would love to do a show with you guys.” So at that point, that’s when he started adjusting the whole thing with Richard Kern to do that. [15:20] And you pushed him to do an installation.\nVC: Yeah. I used to go to breakfast with him a lot. So, disclosure, I was in this all-girl rock band, well, one guy in the band. And we had toured with The Clash. So this was obviously, at that moment, something that this is of interest, and I can still play in the band,\nJR: And David Loved The Clash. He’s got that, the cover of one Clash album is in that big train painting, so we know that he loved Give ‘Em Enough Rope. He loved that.\nVC: So the band was also political, punk; it’s already another energy. So we used to go and talk a lot. And ironically, I’m just finishing my French PhD, but at that time I was talking about Roland Barthes and a lot of that, the idea of mythologies, his book Mythologies, and coming off the wall and breaking the concept of what art was. And I was sort of disturbed by conceptual art that had just become so sterile. Because I guess it’s sort of like the old, you know, the old quarrel, it’s like reason against passion, and how do you get the two together was sort of, can we get the two together? Can we do this? Can we recreate narrative as opposed to break it apart?\nGW: And so David was right in there with you as you were discussing these ideas.\nVC: Yes; yes.\nJR: He had done a couple installations. He did one at 51X.\nVC: Yes.\nJR: That was an underground space, and I remember it had some of those babies crawling around with the maps on them. Then he also did something at the Anchorage that had some of his skeletons in a tableau. But what he was going to do for us was a much more kind of coherently orchestrated.\nGW: Could you describe that first exhibit?\nVC: Yeah, um.\nGW: Do you remember it well enough?\nJR: Which?\nGW: The one you said you did the first exhibit with David, or that he – maybe I misunderstood you.\nVC: You Killed Me First.\nJR: The one that we did, well that was the Acid show.\nVC: No, no, no; the first gallery show with David.\nJR: The first installation show that he had, we didn’t do that show. That was 51X.\nVC: No, no, no; at our gallery, they’re asking about.\nGW: The first show that you did with David at your gallery.\nJR: The first show we did there, You Killed Me First. Okay; we’re just getting to that.\nVC: Get to it; get to it now.\nJR: Yeah, yeah; okay. Well, he basically worked with Richard Kern to make a film about this young punk girl that gets a lot of flak from her family and kills them all at Thanksgiving dinner. So, she, the girl was played by this young Lung Leg, she called herself.\nMT: We actually have a manuscript of her; she was trying to put together a book of her poetry.\nJR: Oh, yeah, yeah; I remember she showed us her poetry. Karen Finley played the mother, David played the father. And then David kind of co-wrote the script to the point that he definitely based the father on his own father, who had like pulled a gun on his mother at dinner once. He was kind of a sailor, kind of an alcoholic sailor guy. Anyway, he was, according to David, a very abusive character. So David focused a lot of his performance on recreating this guy. Anyway, David plays the father, he like chops the girl’s rabbit, I mean, just a whole succession of events happens in this film that drives this girl to the point of killing her family. Well; what he did then, they had the film made, and they came in, and what we had, the gallery on Tenth Street was another long kind of railroad space, deep and narrow. And there was a back room clearly demarked, like with a wall. So the gallery itself is quite deep. It had been the Limbo Lounge before. It had like this stone floor. And in the middle of the space they built a cement-block wall with just one window in it with like broken glass. And in the front, David painted “24 hours No Parking” and some fake graffiti on it. They strewed garbage and like brought all kinds of\nVC: Which they got a lot of from, they went across the road to the park and collected dead leaves.\nJR: At the time the park was really a garbage dump.\nVC: And it was real garbage.\nJR: And dog shit and everything; I mean, it really was a mess.\nVC: [laughing] A special moment for us.\nJR: Inside the room, there was just enough room – it was like a small room at the end. When you looked in through the broken window what you saw was a kitchen table,\nVC: Dining table.\nJR: With like a Thanksgiving feast, which over the months rotted progressively. And they seated three skeletons around the table. And they were David’s things with kind of flesh, you know, like the Walking Dead, the way they have the Walking Dead skeletons now. But at the time, it was like, you’d see a little bit of David’s kind of maps that were glued onto the skeletons, creeping up, but mostly rotted, bloody flesh and clothing. And like, you know, the one figure was like the sister and then the mother, and then on the right side was the father, with his head – which was David. So he’s actually making his own rotted body there. And the blood splattered all over the walls, which was actually real pig’s blood. So boy, I’ll tell you, by the end of the month, this was a very ripe, frickin’ smell on this thing. And in the corner of the room was a little TV monitor which played the film on a loop. So believe me, over the months, we memorized that thing; you know?\nVC: “Why don’t you rip it up and write ‘Motherfucker’ on it?” That was just going, with Karen Finley’s voice, very strident.\nJR: I mean, it’s a very potent thing. As you came in, it was quite dark, so people were intimidated coming into this room. And then you’d have to intentionally navigate quite a ways down to see the broken window, and then you’d see this horrific scene.\nGW: Did he have anything to say about the lighting? Did he want it to be dark?\nJR: Oh yeah, it was all the way he wanted it.\nVC: Oh yes; totally.\nJR: There was actually a little tape recorder in the corner with a foghorn noise. It was definitely intimidating __[21:25]\nVC: The lighting, there was a blue light on the No Parking. And it wasn’t lit, so essentially it was a dark room with a blue light coming across onto the No Parking.\nJR: If you were opening the door, coming in from the light, it was like: Shit, this looks like a really frickin’ alley.\nVC: It was really very dark and it looked like an alley. And a lot of people didn’t get any further than just coming into the front.\nJR: Yeah.\nGW: So he really could control every aspect of the installation, right? It was all his idea.\nVC: Oh yes.\nJR: Absolutely.\nVC: Yes; absolutely.\nGW: Did you have any signage or announcing the __?\nJR: Well, in the front it says “Ground Zero” on the window. I mean it’s clearly and we’d have the door propped open.\nGW: Any explanation of the work on the wall?\nJR: No.\nVC: No.\nGW: Would he have wanted something like that?\nJR: No.\nVC: No.\nGW: No.\nJR: No idiot-proofing __. [22:10 laughing] If you have the courage to go in there and look at this thing, that’s it.\nVC: Yes.\nJR: And I think we did do an ad in the East Village Eye for it.\nVC: And did you know, I mean, what was so interesting about this was, and I guess this is why we got on so well, we actually enjoyed the fact that people came in and were terrified. Now this is really about taking it to the next level of like, what does it mean to have a gallery, and what does it mean to be an art viewer, and what does it mean to participate in the experience of a piece of art? So here you are and you come in and, as we said, people didn’t even get in the door; they’d just open the door and freak out.\nJR: It really is a crime scene.\nVC: And leave. Yes, it was very bloody.\nJR: And people were not so inured to the idea of like the kind of Walking Dead thing like they are now. That was really like, Oh my god! And it smelled. And it was like: This shit looks real.\nVC: And when you got down to the end of the room, which was quite a long way down,\nJR: Yeah; it was a long ways down.\nVC: And you had picked your way through this garbage, and all of this, this is a small window. So it’s what, about 24 by 24?\nJR: So only like two or three people could see it at once.\nVC: People had to crowd in to be able to see it. So there was even a confrontational moment as you tried to see through this window. And also people weren’t sure that they were supposed to be looking through this window. So this idea of privacy and the public sphere is also addressed there. And personal space in a darkened, scary environment, so there’s some jostling to try and see it, and then try and navigate whether you should be looking around. And then this noise going, and then, all of a sudden, here’s the foghorns going. And it’s very overwhelming. And then, the film itself is quite aggressive, and David humping Karen Finley like and her screaming at the top of her lungs.\nJR: It’s just awful.\nVC: Really, oh my god, you know.\nGW: This is extreme.\nVC: It was very extreme.\nGW: So how would you sort of characterize his thoughts, if you can remember, or if you know, about, I mean the difference between say exhibiting in the Pier, exhibiting or doing street art, exhibiting in your gallery, and maybe exhibiting in a more white-cube space?\nJR: Well we definitely, it was making, I mean, you know, other people were trying to get him to do more of painting paintings. He did give us a piece for the back room which is one of his posters from Buenos Aires, so we had a piece to sell, and we did sell it to Corrado Levi. So that was, it kind of offset at least some of our expenditure for that month. But he also did mention that he was somewhat slightly influenced by Marcel Duchamp’s last piece that’s in Philadelphia there, where it’s like the peep show through the window. So there was a certain aspect of that, the voyeurism. And there’s even a sequence of voyeurism in our book, the Seven Miles a Second, in the first section where David’s peeping through the hole of the door. So this is a recurring motif in the work.\nVC: I had actually spoken to David a little bit about – and I’ve spoken about this before, but it just occurred to me, A rebours, you know, the Huysmans book, and just the idea of having, creating fake environments and voyeurism and that whole thing. And there was another book by Henri Barbusse called l’Enfer, that we spoke about, which it happens, I think he wrote it in Algeria, but there’s a man who is watching everything through a wardrobe as everything unfolds in the next room. So, you know, these are definitely\nJR: Isn’t there also a sequence in the Proust.\nVC: Yes, there’s a sequence in the Proust. I didn’t mention the Proust at that time because I hadn’t read the whole Proust at that time; thank you very much.\nJR: It’s there in all the greats. [laughter]\nMT: I’ve always wondered, and I’ve never known this, just how much theory and how much literature did David read? Because his work seems so inflected by critical theory.\nJR: He was quite widely read. I mean, there was a lot of stuff kicking around his apartment.\nVC: Later on, of course, he was reading Foucault.\nMT: Oh, okay. Well that certainly makes sense.\nVC: That makes, you know – but that wasn’t until quite a lot of people who suddenly came to Foucault at that moment.\nMT: Yes.\nVC: But we certainly spoke about Roland Barthes, who had been very key.\nJR: The more he wrote the more he read, I think. He was becoming very well read.\nVC: And I know that he loved Against Nature, I mean, loved it, of course, of course.\nMT: That makes perfect sense, too.\nVC: Yes, and he had been reading\nJR: Well, Marguerite definitely aimed him at that.\nVC: So he had been reading around that sort of outsider topics and I think probably Camus __[26:35]\nJR: Well that whole show that he did at the end of the flowers was definitely influenced by the A rebours conversations that he had with Marguerite.\nVC: Yeah, I think.\nJR: The flowers as a very fertile image of decay and all the stuff going on __.\nVC: Decaying __ity, you know, all of that stuff. And you know, I mean, who doesn’t love that book? The __ book? It’s the best.\nMT: Yes; exactly.\nVC: And we totally enjoyed the whole conversations around that, and what that means. So I think he was theoretical. I think he was starting to read theory. I know he loved literature and was a good reader, was a strong reader.\nJR: I mean that’s actually, I think some of the influence he had from his mother, even though he kind of, he portrayed himself as quite the waif. But there was a place where, and you can see, because I remember looking at the show that you had here at the library, where he’s talking back and forth to his mother, and they were close, to a point. And she was having him read certain types of things. She was an intelligent and read woman. So, I mean, there was more connection there than sometimes he showed later on.\nMT: Because we have his library, but I was never sure what was his and what was Peter’s, in the library, because they both came from the loft. And so that’s – but this is really helpful in understanding.\nJR: Well Peter certainly would have shown him things and said, read; look at this; look at this. And that’s what that was; that’s something that different people have told me, that the relationship was, Peter was not really a romance so much as it was very much like a mentor and the young follower. Like, Peter taught David. And he stopped, David was never a junkie. Peter disapproved so strongly when David dabbled with any kind of drugs; David stopped; that was it. And he listened to Peter. So that was, that’s a key relationship but it’s not really a romantic relationship.\nMT: Tom has said that, that in the beginning, they may have tricked a bit, but it became something very different.\nJR: Yeah.\nVC: Yes. I mean, so, you know, I’m talking about, with this installation, I mean, we had talked about all of those ideas. So they were on the table. It wasn’t as if a completely naïve, I mean, I think that goes back to the idea of what, the sort of rational, cold-bloodedness of the conceptual world as opposed to this incredible exuberant expressionistic punk thing. But this is informed, so that was the conversation, how do you inform that type of consciousness with the production of art, with objects, with an environment? And how do we, you know, and then of course we’re completely revolutionary in our take. And how do we now disrupt the art world? How do we disrupt and fracture this set of structured imperialism? [laughing]\nMT: Mm-hm, mm-hm.\nGW: You had talked to him about these questions?\nVC: Oh yeah. I mean, and who could ever forget the dumping of the meat over at?\nJR: Or the cockabunnies? The things that he would do.\nGW: Well, maybe you could describe some of the other installations that he did, or some of the art projects.\nJR: Well, he did the one where he dumped the cow bones in Leo Castelli’s – it was like bloody cow bones in Leo Castelli’s staircase.\nVC: Which he did with Julie Hair; the two of them did that.\nJR: Then he did the cockabunnies. He glued little bunny ears on cockroaches and set them loose in the gallery; I don’t remember where that was, but he did things like that.\nGW: Were there other major exhibits at your gallery?\nJR: The other installations I saw that he did was one in the 51X that I mentioned. I don’t know if there are pictures. I haven’t seen any pictures of that.\nMT: Yeah, I didn’t know anything about that.\nJR: Usually they were like a painting on the wall with odd objects. And David was very much – he collected crap. And I always remember, I actually added, when I did the second edition of Seven Miles a Second, we added a spread of him driving his car, where it shows that front dashboard. He had all of this crap on the dashboard.\nVC: Objets. [laughing]\nJR: Little toys and all of this stuff, and I said, “David, if you ever get in a car accident, that stuff’s all going to end up embedded in your forehead.” [laughing] But it was all kinds of stuff. And road kill. He’d find something on the road and he’d put it up there. This is like some grisly stuff. And Popeye and the Flintstones.\nVC: But even if he just did a small piece, for example, the crawling babies, you know, and he had done the map babies. And they were chained to the gallery wall on a little platform. So, you know, the baby is trying to leave and it keeps, it’s pulled back with a string.\nJR: She had made a, these huge, she got these huge photo murals of the forest or something, and then she painted falling radioactive babies falling through it. And so we put that on the wall, and then David built a little shelf onto that. And he’d buy these little crawling babies down on Orchard Street, they’d have these little crawling babies. And so he’d take those and glue maps to them, and then tether them with a little string around their neck to the thing, so they’re just like crawling on the shelf.\nVC: Yes, they were so funny.\nJR: Then he had those I remember also in 51X, he was using those at that time, as well.\nVC: Yes, I loved the crawling babies.\nJR: But he would collect this kind of stuff, you know, and little dried up dead animals, and he just had tons of stuff. Or like he’d go out and buy skeletons. So I was amazed when I saw that recent picture, the installation with the tree. He had a tree in this installation that was the private people’s thing. It was a tree, but he had hanging like fruit, were like five different huge animal skulls, all covered with maps and painted slightly with kind of tribal motifs on them. And so he – I don’t know. It’s quite expensive to go buy these these kind of bone. And I think it’s actually illegal at this point to even get these kind of things. So, I don’t know, but I think for years he was collecting skeletons. He’d go out to the desert and he’d fill up the back of the station wagon with all kinds of smelly old stuff; you know. [laughing]\nVC: And I mean, you know, in the first show I saw of his at Civilian, he had one of the globes hanging out from the wall. And there’s a lot of people there, and it’s in motion. And I do think that the kinetic aspect was always attractive to David, that he liked things to move. And he did the installation when they recreated an installation at, um, the New Museum, when it was on Broadway.\nJR: Right.\nVC: And he had, they had a film going there, with Howdy Doody in it, and actually, Crosby, my son, is one of the babies in that.\nJR: Howdy Doody with Koch’s voice going, “How am I doin’? How am I doin’?” You know, like that. [laughing]\nVC: And it had Crosby as the baby in some of that stuff, he __[33:32] baby.\nGW: What do you think about these reinstallations and reimagining, if it’s a better word?\nJR: Well, they’d better do it right if they’re gonna do it, that’s the point.\nGW: And how does one do it right?\nJR: Well you have to figure out, either find somebody that saw it the way it was, or, you know, I mean, I can remember__[33:47]\nVC: But I think as well that the idea -- so, here’s where it gets complicated. The second show he did with us was wall paintings. We could say that, and then he had a piece that had explosives on it, you know, all of these firecrackers. And Joe Coleman standing in front of that with a cigar the entire opening and threatening to blow it up. [laughter] And David did in fact blow it up.\nJR: He blew it up in the film, Fire in My Belly. So that’s the piece you see exploding. The portrait of Bishop Landa, and who was the guy who destroyed the Mayan Codexes. So there was a deliberate comment that he made in this thing. But he also had another painting in that show which was the portrait of Tommy Turner.\nVC: Oh yes.\nJR: But when we showed it, it was this white painting of Tommy with like Frankenstein; Tommy’s Dream, it’s called. So it was like all these monsters surrounding Tommy, who was going into withdrawal. He was trying to dry out while he was traveling in Mexico with David. Anyway, when we showed it, it had a stick coming out of the top of the painting; hanging from that was this horrible little Mexican puppet. Well, we still have the Mexican puppet. Nobody ever asked us for it and so now they keep showing this painting without the stick and the Mexican puppet, which was part of the piece. I don’t know who it belongs to, but in the New Museum they never showed it the way it was supposed to be shown.\nVC: I think anybody that has to recreate David’s work needs to resist the impulse to make it in good taste.\nGW: That’s a good guiding principle.\nMT: Mm-hm; mm-hm.\nVC: He was so not about good – not making it comfortable; it didn’t need to be this pleasant experience. I mean, this thing was, the puppet’s awful, you know. It’s one of those really awful puppets. [laughing] And I can imagine it would have deterred quite a few people from wanting to own this thing as an object. So,\nJR: Well, that’s true. You read my piece about the Smithsonian thing, right? I mean, my differentiation with that, in terms of what was eventually shown in the restored version wasn’t anything like the original. And then people were saying, “Oh no, David wasn’t attacking the Catholic church.” It’s like, bullshit; he was totally attacking the Catholic Church. He saw that as what was actually hurting the Mexican people. And he’s traveling in Mexico, and they’re all like just completely repressed by this engine of the Catholic Church. So yeah, he was definitely attacking it. And so, to say no he wasn’t, to have some kind of like idea like, oh no, we wouldn’t want to attack religion.\nVC: I have to say, I actually made stickers after his death. There was, what’s the, Bendel’s – what’s the big department store across from St. Patrick’s? They had window installations of David’s there. And I thought to myself, he would have had a shitfit, excuse my French. But he would not have enjoyed this. This would not have been something\nJR: Maybe he would have wanted it there, but he would have wanted something aggressive.\nVC: But whatever they did, he would not have enjoyed.\nGW: Well, what is it that he wouldn’t have liked about it?\nVC: The location? [laughing]\nJR: Well, the location would be good if it was saying what he wanted it to say.\nVC: It was sort of cute, the way it was handled and it was like.\nJR: Was that done after his death?\nVC: Yes, it was well after his death. I made stickers of him smashing St. Pat’s, sort of comic, and I went and put a few on the window just to make the point. [laughing]\nJR: If that was him, he would have definitely taken that opportunity to make an installation about the Catholic Church, because it’s right there; you know what I mean? That’s where you would do it; you know?\nVC: So I mean, that probably, you know, yes, the good taste issue, right there.\nJR: And then the place probably would have gone: No, you can’t do that. And it would have lasted for about two days and it would have been canceled. David wasn’t afraid to\nVC: And David would have protested his own show. [laughter]\nGW: One of the things that I’m worried about and I know Marvin is as well, is that as time goes on, we start to historicize David Wojnarowicz and other artists of the era, and they start to enter museum collections which are white cubes, and so they enter into sort of museum thinking about how do we portray the past. And so there is this desire to recreate the spirit, the environment, but it’s very difficult in a white cube and very difficult, and I think we’re concerned that something about the ethos of the era will be lost.\nVC: I think it’s very important to remember that he had a sense of humor. And I think that gets lost so much in the interpretation of his work when it’s recreated. Anecdotally, the show that they had at the New Museum, I happened to run into Kikki Smith. The two of us were standing in front of this thing, and it’s going, “How am I doin’? How am I doin’?” And it was so goofy.\nJR: A big, paper maché head, and it was goofy. We went, ‘Boy, that looks like typically half-ass kind of slapped together thing.’\nVC: He didn’t always take himself so seriously.\nJR: It wasn’t perfect, I mean, for Christ’s sake.\nVC: Perfection was not necessary.\nJR: We were laughing, we were laughing our asses off.\nVC: So I’m laughing and Kikki’s laughing, and this woman came over and told us off. “How dare you!”\nJR: How dare you laugh at the Saint David Wojnarowicz. [laughter] I was like, you know, we knew David and __[39:00]\nVC: We didn’t say anything, We just looked __ so sorry.\nJR: Fricking paper maché is ridiculous. Come on. It looks like he slapped it together with Elmer’s Glue, you know? And there is something when you look at some of those paintings, and as a conservator, right? You’re going to look at, like, we borrowed. Remember when we did the Mumia [?] 911 show and we borrowed a painting of David’s from PPOW, and we were carrying it, and was like, the lathing, he had gotten this cheap-shit lathing that he had framed the thing with, and as I’m picking the thing up, the thing came off in my hand, and it was like: Oh my god, he put like two nails in the side of this goddamn thing. It’s not really secured properly. It’s like, god, he just did it in a hurry and he put it together and he took it to the gallery and that was it. And it wasn’t like __maybe put together the most solid was for the ages; you know?\nVC: There were moments when you, for example, the later work is a lot more prepared for conservation, if you like. He, that’s legacy, you know, the big four paintings; that’s legacy work. Those are designed to be, you know, put me in a museum, I need to be kept.\nJR: But he was doing that himself. He didn’t have an assistant, I don’t believe.\nVC: No, no, no; he never had any kind of assistants.\nJR: Physically I don’t know how he did some of that stuff towards the end when he was weakening.\nGW: That’s very interesting that you say that. He was at that point thinking of his legacy. And you know, conservators have a lot of tension with this type of art that is meant to be sort of falling apart, meant to stink, meant to be haphazard. And yet, certainly in the museum context, we’re worried about public safety; we’re worried about people knocking things over. We’re worried about, should we clean it; how far should we clean it? Should we somehow stabilize or make it more structurally strong so it actually can survive into the future?\nJR: Have you had any problems with like the spray paint starting to crack off, or?\nGW: Oh yes.\nJR: The maps, how well did he glue those down? And earlier on maybe\nGW: These are the kind of questions. Do we allow it to deteriorate and allow present generations to experience it, or do we inject adhesives and do repairs so that it can last into the future?\nJR: I think he’d want it to last.\nVC: I think he’d want it to last. [laughing] I don’t think there’s an absence of ego in this case.\nJR: We have a piece in our storage of this snake that had been in the, it had been the,\nVC: Yes, but that, he lavished a lot of care on the painting of that because\nJR: Yeah, it needs some restoration.\nVC: So there were moments that you know, he is very invested in the painting and you can really see that, and he spends a huge amount of time. Because, you know, frankly, he learned to paint as he went along. In the beginning, he didn’t know as much about painting as he came to learn at the end. And\nJR: It’s a shame really, when he just really had started to get it, then.\nVC: He had just hit his stride. I mean, he had an innate, he had everything there in place in the mind, the hand, the body, and the sensibility. He was an apprentice to himself, if you will. By the end, he had learned to paint,\nJR: You know that last piece he did, the really big elaborate thing? It was in my piece, I link to it. Very elaborate piece with – it was one of his last paintings. This huge thing. I can’t think of the name of it. I could show it to you on line. But it’s accomplished. And it’s just, he really had just gotten it and put all his things together, the montage, the photography, and how to assemble all these things into these beautifully orchestrated things.\nVC: I think that sometimes when he worked with the grey and white, he was using photographs and a little bit frightened of using more color in any kind of representational way. So he has a painting __[43:05] because I can’t paint; I don’t know how to paint. So the grey at times has to do with both looking at black-and-white photographs and being a little anxious and wanting to demonstrate that he can draw. So there’s that anxiety that he had of, you know -- I think that a lot of people had it, but -- will I be taken seriously if my craftsmanship is not up to a certain level, and you know, having that push-back because some of the early work was very thrown on. But he was working in this figurative __. Again goes to that same anxiety, same conversation, how does one bridge that gap between the conceptual and what’s the parameters of things being representational and not representational.\nGW: So someone who is interpreting this work or curating or conserving his work in the future might also be advised to think about what point in his career he created it. Because you’re describing a certain evolution.\nVC: Yes, and anxiety. So, I mean, the anxiety is a really good word to use when you’re thinking about David’s work, in terms of both his own production of anxiety for the viewer, but also his own anxiety during the production of the work and how that informs what he’s doing with that work. So, I mean, we all love the posters from the supermarkets. But that’s a sort of ready-made that covers you. So it picks up some of your anxiety because it’s giving you this background to work on, you know, and they’re among the very young artists at this point. It’s like a massive, you know, self-education process going on.\nJR: Well it is a big growth spurt and it’s quite a compressed period of time. So you’re looking at just like a point from like maybe ’77 or something to very early ‘90s, and it all happens in there, so you have like early work and middle period and then later\nGW: In a decade. __[45:09]\nJR: In a decade, literally. So, yeah, big difference.\nVC: Also, we were all doing – there were so many group shows we were producing, what? Literally on a daily, two daily, weekly, to meet these goals.\nJR: Yeah. Somebody wants something for a show, so you do it overnight and then it’s there the next day.\nVC: And then, you know, the bane of my life, the theme show. [laughing] Which is, there was always a theme in the East Village. So then you would have to step outside of anything you had been thinking about and all of a sudden you’re creating something for the theme show. So that’s sort of another thing that you might think about, that there are these works that seem to be out of place, but that’s because they were part of this conversation that was happening. So there’s a huge amount of conversation and response and back and forth between everybody.\nJR: Well also there was a point where, like, I noticed like when we did the second show of David’s, the Mexican Diaries which I only just managed to recently finally get back onto his resume because it had been left off, those were just paintings but, for instance, one of the best ones was this painting called Street Kid of a bandaged hand with coins on it and other stuff in the background, these Mexican Wanted posters. It was a painting but we didn’t sell it and the next time I saw it, it was in the back of Gracie Mansion’s like maybe three or four years later, and he had completely transformed it and painted all of these vines going across it and obscuring some of the original stuff. So he had gotten it back and he got, I’m going to keep going with this. So we have slides of it in its earlier state. And then it exists in this so you might go, “Oh, here’s this painting,” and you go, “Oh shit, there must be another one.” No, it’s not another one; it’s the same painting in two different states.\nGW: That’s very interesting.\nVC: I mean, I think that goes partly to the question you were asking about conservation, if he would want his work conserved, no question.\nJR: Yeah. You don’t want it to fall apart.\nVC: However, he was not that precious himself, so he would get it. So just, again, the word “anxiety” you have anxiety about preserving David’s work. [laughing] I would not have that anxiety.\nJR: I think he’s important for various reasons. I mean, I don’t know; technically I could compare him to somebody like Art Spiegelman who doesn’t really draw but it’s the structure that’s more important, it’s how they’re putting it together, it’s the ideas that the thing has as a whole. It’s not like, oh, it’s freakin’ Rembrandt. It’s not. It’s like this is a visceral statement and he’s putting it all together and expressing it the way he can. It’s not about being a virtuoso draftsman or something like that.\nVC: We were just talking about this the other day, going and buying the blue paint from --Utrecht blue. That was so prevalent in David’s work. It’s a very unique color.\nJR: If you want to restore his work, you’d have to use the Utrecht paint. You better go buy Utrecht paint before they go out of business or something, because that’s what he used.\nVC: He used to buy the big jars.\nJR: That blue, it’s actually called Utrecht Blue. If you don’t get Utrecht blue you can’t restore the freakin’ thing.\nVC: I tried to match it when we were in Europe and I couldn’t find it. I had to make it. I had to go and buy some, you know.\nJR: Because as I said, we have a piece that needs restoration and we’d have to make sure that we get the right paint.\nGW: Are there other materials that he used that you can recall?\nVC: Some of the turquoises are just house paint. It was the same paint that was on the front of Civilian Warfare. Right. That was a bought off the shelf.\nJR: House paint, the bane of the restoration, of the conservators.\nGW: Yes.\nVC: Yes.\nMT: He used it a lot. We have a lot of it.\nVC: But mainly Utrecht, a lot of Utrecht paints.\nJR: If it was ever rolled up, when you pull it back out it’s like ___\nVC: That Utrecht blue, that’s the blue.\nMT: Is that the blue he painted the little monkey skeleton? Do you know the monkey’s head?\nVC: Yes.\nMT: So that’s it. Because it’s in the Magic Box, and it’s that blue.\nVC: Yes, that’s the blue.\nJR: It’s the Utrecht blue.\nMT: That’s fascinating.\nJR: And maybe towards the other end of his career he might have started to use a little better supplies. I don’t know though. David was like an economical guy. Some of the places where we really first bonded with him maybe more was when we did the collaborations when we drove with him to Virginia. And it was like a whole group of us and we were all painting together in a room, and so then we all kind of mixed art supplies. So we had to use some of his paint because we didn’t have any paint, you know, and we were like making a slop over there in the corner.\nGW: Could you talk a little bit more about the collaborations? Because I think, you know, since we’re having this conversation for researchers in the future, they inevitably have questions of authorship and questions of how it actually worked between David and other artists. How did it work? Did he often take the lead? Or did other people have an idea and he would jump in?\nJR: I don’t think it was really a matter of anybody taking the lead.\nVC: I mean, when we did the Virginia trip, which was Marilyn Minter and Christof Kohlhofer were on that.\nJR: David West.\nVC: David West. Tessa and Carlo were there.\nJR: Luis Frangella.\nVC: Luis Frangella. Who else?\nJR: Now he did works with Luis Frangella where they collaborated quite smoothly on some of those Buenos Aires posters, as a matter of fact. And they’re beautiful, and you couldn’t – I would say it’s almost impossible to say who did what. I saw one of a shanty town. I love it. It’s beautiful. But I can’t actually tell who did what on that. And I watched them working together and they had almost, like, either David was really watching Luis and seeing how his – because Luis had such a beautiful brush line. David’s brush line got better from watching Luis paint.\nVC: And Luis you see use a very long brush. I mean, it was so elegant to watch him. So this was just like a pure pleasure to watch this guy paint.\nMT: He did those massive things at the piers, as well.\nVC: Yes.\nJR: Right, he did that big genie on the side of the ABC of the big skull, you know, muscle face thing.\nVC: I mean, if you could sort of speak to the actual act of making the art, you know, Luis, to watch him actually make the art was as much of the process as the final piece. It was absolutely stunning, it was beautiful, and it was something to see.\nJR: And he had the beautiful hand. So then David would go, oh here’s the, like maybe push towards a more push on the subject matter but then absorb technical information from who’s around him. I know he talked to you about photography. He did a whole show with Marion that was these assemblage pieces, mixed photography and painting. At Tim Greathouse they did a collaborative show together, so that was a whole show of collaborations. With us he did, well, we did these several messes like the painting mess in Virginia. We did one at our gallery.\nVC: [laughing] The painting mess.\nJR: We did one at our gallery of The Nuclear Family. It’s the same title we just used for that show with Crosby __[52:08]\nVC: Everybody sort of grabbed a space, to start off with, because this was a huge gallery. So we all grabbed a space and people started to work in their own spaces.\nJR: They were all mixing together.\nVC: __[52:20]\nJR: But we stayed in the same space.\nVC: You know, it starts with David West who we love and is just genius, starts writing “do-da, dada, you killed me mama goo” and then David’s like, and then they do these needlenoses, right? Those little flying things with the pointy noses; dweezles. And then they just start appearing everywhere. The issue is, which we learned, at this point, you have to really trust the people that you’re working with. So, to the extent that they’re going to look at it, and you know, you can’t have anxiety if somebody paints over your work. But you have to hope that they’re not going to paint over your work because you have this sort of: Oh, that’s a great piece. Mmmm, not so much. Okay. Everybody would just look at each other; yeah, go for it. __\nJR: Well, they did the same type of thing at the Ground Zero one. And that was a hideous ugly mess. But, David did take a specific wall and he painted a big squawky head, like he does with the dots in the eyes, but he made it a killer cop who had like skulls spilling out of his mouth. So it was like a very focused political statement in this one little place that David made, and the rest of it just unbelievable slop.\nVC: Everybody just goes kind of nuts in there. I don’t know; it’s some good pieces. I resent that.\nJR: Occasionally bits and pieces. You did a pretty piece over here. I mean, you know, there’s different things going on, or Keiko Bonk did a nice little motorcycle with a whatever the hell it was, a mouse riding a motorcycle or something. What the hell was that?\nVC: I mean, there was __[53:45] collaboration. It’s not that you want to be exclusive because you don’t like people, but you have to kind of be really careful. It’s like dropping acid with a certain group of people. You don’t want to drop acid with the wrong people. So you know, this is kind of, yeah, it’s very close to that experience where, you know, the music’s going. If you don’t like that music, it’s just like, “I can’t work in this.” So, you know, there’s a sort of relaxed-ness that comes.\nJR: I mean, there’s a point where the East Village started, there was like, I kind of came in late, but I was working with World War III magazine which is more like comics. Marguerite was in bands. But as it came to, really, what was interesting about the East Village and going to someplace like Danceteria, there really wasn’t a demarcation between visual artists and performance artists and musicians. Like, we all were hanging together. And like, the musician would say, “Can you come and do” something. We would work together in that way. And then sometimes I’d be in a band or somebody, one of the musicians would come and do a painting whether they could even paint or not. Or I’d be playing because even if I couldn’t play, it didn’t – it wasn’t so segmented as it is now, I think, in some ways.\nVC: Yeah.\nJR: People were open to collaboration and I think it’s a healthy thing to collaborate because you’re getting – I think David learned from us just as we learned from him. So really, I don’t think there was a hierarchical thing of like, oh, so-and-so is in charge. I think David would very much have resented somebody saying, like, oh, he was in charge of the collaboration with Kern. He made sure that he did the film with Richard and he also Richard did the installation with him. So you can’t really say that one did the other. With the collaborations with Marion, they both worked on it. It wasn’t like, oh, so-and-so was in charge. And like in the comic, is the same thing, even though\nGW: Can you tell us a little bit about that. Seven Miles a Second is it?\nJR: Right. I started that with David in maybe ’86. And I guess at some point I would have assumed that I was going to color it. But by the time it ended up getting colored, it was logical that Marguerite would do it, because she knew David’s palette. And she had a different kind of take on it. And if I did it, I would have used these other references. So, in essence, she became the third collaborator and the third co-author of the book.\nVC: And just to say to that, I made some unusual choices. But I knew what David liked in my work because he told me. I knew where he liked the color and where he didn’t like the color. I knew his paints. I’d use his paints. So all of that was present. And then later on I as here in Fales, and I was looking in one of the boxes, and there was a note about one of the scenes from the comic. And I had, intuitively I gave it this bright pink, dark pink sky with the yellow. And there was a note: Magenta sky.\nJR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nVC: And I was so vindicated; I felt so relieved. Anxiety; there’s that word again.\nJR: I mean, when I started it with him, he said, you know, like, okay, I want this three-part structure: me as a child, me as a teenager, and me as an adult. And he kind of gave me just this stack of typewritten stuff. So I kind of edited bits out of it. He said, “Well I kind of like this.” He had a kind of a rough structure that he wanted to adhere to. And then I found pieces in the writing that he gave me that would correspond to or that we could put together so we’d have like, there’s one monologue over here and another monologue over here, and I put it together so the two people were talking on top of each other. But that’s kind of how it happens in life; you know? And he liked that kind of thing. It’s like an Antonioni or something; you have people talking on top of each other. Like this and that. So he’s aware of all of these things. And we’re talking about it. And so I put, you know, I roughly edited together what he had asked for out of what it was. It’s still my edit, so to speak, but I tried to keep the words that worked the best as words, and then you’re drawing – you see, you don’t want redundancy between the visual and the text, but you also want to keep the best language intact.\nGW: So would he then comment on your drafts?\nJR: Yeah, he loved, he liked, he saw the first two parts. It’s a three part structure; he saw the first two parts finished, up to a point. Not with color, but he approved the edits.\nVC: James has long scrolls. [laughing]\nJR: I’d take these things and I’d cut it together and tape it together. It’s like a scroll.\nVC: Because we forget William Burroughs is, of course, you know, always present. [laughing]\nJR: I have a picture of it on line. I can send you the link to the place where I have a picture of the scrolls on line. And then you can see he scribbled in little bits and he added, like, he’d see how I structured the page, and he’d go, “Okay, well,” and he’d add a word balloon coming out of somebody’s mouth, or whatever, like that. So we got all the way through but then he died before we did the last piece. We had had some discussions about how the last part would play out, but I mean, there was one thing that he wanted me to do which was, like, end the thing with this like happy sunny day where he’s just happy to be alive. But there is like literally nothing in his writing that corresponded with that so I couldn’t do that. You know? I mean, really, it’s like a book where the actual author dies, writes his own death, so to speak.\nGW: And so you, after his death, you completed it.\nJR: I had to complete the final part. Tom Rauffenbart gave me access to his final journal. And hopefully, some of that still hasn’t reached print, because some of it I don’t think really was intended to be published. Because there was some pretty personal,\nMT: It hasn’t been published, not everything.\nJR: Rough comments about some people that I know he loved them, but David, he never really held back what he had to say. [laughing] So it’s a little intense. But I know some of that stuff came out and I just didn’t even want to look at it, because I didn’t want to know what came out. But I read all of it. It was pretty harrowing. __[59:43]\nVC: It was hard on you, as well, because, you know, we’re working on our dead friend’s __.\nJR: Well, I feel bad because he did say, “Oh, I just want to see the thing done.” And then I didn’t get it done. I was too slow. __\n: But you did get it done in the end.\nJR: I did get it done in the end.\nVC: Yes, and it’s been redone and we’re happy about that.\nJR: The one that’s out I think is the closest to what it was supposed to be.\nVC: Yes. David definitely was, I mean, that’s another aspect of David hoping that things would be accessible, and wanting actually young people to see this work, and which was why the comic was a good medium. And, you know, wanting to reach a broader audience.\nJR: We mainframed that thing.\nVC: He wasn’t somebody reclusive. I think it’s very, very key that he wanted to be seen and he wanted his work to go to a broader audience.\nJR: Even the first edition, you can’t get much more mainstream than Time Warner DC Comics, you know what I mean? Then he did like 25,000 copies but they wouldn’t keep it in print now. It’s at an alternative publisher. But they did it perfect. And it also went to France, right now, there’s an edition out there.\nVC: But I do think, and I said it once before, but I’ll just repeat this, I do think it’s important to remember that David had a sense of humor. We had a song when we were in Belgium, we had made a recording, and it’s a very sort of cute, pop-y song. If I could sing a song as beautiful as you, the birds would stop their singing just to listen to my song.\nJR: I think we’ve probably got that tape.\nVC: It’s on his answering machine. And it was what you, when you called David, all through the wild mélange, through all of it, that’s what you got. [laughing]\nJR: Marvin’s got everything here. [laughing]\nVC: (Singing) It’s beautiful, it’s wonderful, I’m in love with you. Oh my god. [laughter] That’s a sweet song. But I mean, that’s David. He was like, you know, people would imagine they were going to get some really, (in a deep voice) “Hello, this is the Wojnarowicz residence; enter at your peril.”\nJR: To me, one of the best installations he ever did, he didn’t even claim credit for. It was anonymous. There was a thing at PPOW called The Lazaretto. And a lot of that was David. When you walked in there was a room with a skeleton on a bed, with like one of David’s texts on the wall, and all of the AIDS drugs on the bedside table, and it was a rotting person just sitting. And I actually drew, one of my drawings in Seven Miles a Second is based on that rotting corpse on the bed. And then when you went around the corner, there was this giant boat or something. I can’t really remember it clearly, but you followed the path through and a lot of the pieces were done by different people. But it was not a credited thing, I don’t know if you remember seeing that?\nMT: Did they reinstall it?\nJR: They might have.\nMT: PPOW, when they did a show of several years ago, because I remember\nJR: The original.\nMT: Yeah, I remember it.\nJR: Yeah, it was very memorable. Then at the end, you’d get to this thing and it was the Howdy Doody puppet\nMT: Right; yes.\nJR: Using Ed Koch’s voice going, “How am I doin’?” And Ed Koch, all of these people died under Ed Koch’s watch, you know.\nMT: Yeah; I’ve seen that. It’s in my memory.\nJR: But to me, that was one of David’s most powerful things, even though his name wasn’t on it.\nMT: Yeah.\nVC: But I think the other thing was that we all had repertoires of pieces. So Keith Haring, of course, made it his business to trademark his babies and what have you. But we all had them from necessity, because we did these collaborations always sort of like a public performance, although it wasn’t quite public, but it would be. So you’re doing something immediate, and it’s like what can I go to? Oh yeah, I’m going to go to the needle-nosed dweezles, or the googly-eyed head, or the, you know. So we had these little pieces that, you know, I’d do flying babies, David and I did babies, I suppose. __\nJR: David has his lexicon\nVC: He had his lexicon of\nJR: Of imagery that, and you can see the evolution of that when you look at the earlier pieces, there, and he kept those, and he kept expanding that language that he had, a reservoir of imagery that he’d recombine and put in different organizations. And I know in the film storyboard that Marion has, it was almost one of the most full manifestations of that where it was like a piece with insets that’s everything moving and everything shifting and evolving. So I really would love to see that come to fruition.\nMT: I think it’s really important to remember how kinetic the works are.\nVC: Yeah.\nMT: Because that could be easily lost. But in the film you see it again and again. He’s fascinated with things that turn.\nVC: Yes. Absolutely.\nMT: And the piece I wrote for the Whitney catalogue is all about that. It’s about the motion in the works he was trying to do about Peter’s death. Because there’s all of this circular motion.\nJR: So you’ve written something for this. Has this show been postponed?\nMT: It has. It’s going to be winter of 2018.\nJR: I was talking to the guy that was, one of the Davids __.\nMT: “The Davids.” That’s what I refer to them as, the Davids.\nJR: I was pleased to see that they liked my essay and that they’re thinking about that, because we were like: Wow, when am I going to hear from these guys? Well then Cindy put them onto us.\nMT: That’s great.\nGW: Can you think of anything else? We’ve covered a lot of territory here.\nVC: Yes, we have.\nGW: But is there anything that we’ve missed?\nJR: I think when you look at if they were going to reconstruct an installation, for instance, you just have to look at the photographs of what it is. But I think you would need to speak to people that maybe saw it in situ.\nVC: I guess that’s what we do.\nJR: How the hell do you?\nGW: That’s what we’re doing. [laughter]\nVC: What we’re doing; yeah, yeah.\nJR: I mean, I don’t know if you could recreate what we had, that thing. I mean, you could, but where are all of the skeletons?\nGW: Would it have to be perfect to convey what it was?\nVC: No, and I think you could go outside and bring in modern rubbish.\nJR: It was weird because one of the skeletons ended up, one of the skeletons from our show, Tommy took it home, Tommy Turner. And then he divorced his wife, and she was in the apartment, and she took the skeleton and she put it out on the fire escape and left it there. And Tommy was calling up and going, he goes, “I’m going to call the cops and say she killed my friend and left him out on the thing to rot.” You know? Because, can you imagine, the cops go, “Oh my god, there’s like a rotting skeleton on the frickin’ fire escape.” [laughing] __. The ongoing crime scene.\nVC: I guess the other thing, just to say, was that, you know, to do with the __[1:06:15], the whole stencil thing, which was also very important to us all, the idea of things being outside of the gallery as well. Because we had Wigstock, we had the Thompkins Square Park. There were always events in Thompkins Square Park, and taking the art outside, doing your performance outside. So, you know, and with the maps, that whole idea of boundaries is there as well, you know, let’s get rid of these boundaries. That’s like such a David conversation.\nMT: Yes, absolutely. __\nVC: And that was so from the gallery to what goes in the gallery to the park to the neighborhood and to having these discussions to what are the parameters of your friendship. Let’s take it to this, let’s make art. It was always, let’s make art. So I think he’d welcome you if you were trying to recreate his work, he would definitely be pleased. [laughter]\nJR: Do you have a specific example of something that you were having trouble figuring out how to reconstruct it or whatever?\nGW: No, I don’t. I mean, I’m not a curator, but we’re trying to create this information resource for curators, researchers in the future that are trying to understand his work, how to interpret it. And we don’t know what questions they’re going to have, and I have a feeling they’re going to say, “Why didn’t they say this? This is the question I have.” So we may be feeding them information, and they may be trying to read between the lines.\nVC: I think __ circus, I was having a little difficulty [laughing] being overly ethical. We had one of David’s things, and it was just like, bits of paper all glued together, and it was falling apart. And I said, “How do you sell this to somebody? It’s going to fall apart. I’m going to ask them for all this money.” And he said to me, “Oh, they don’t care.”\nJR: Yeah.\nVC: [laughing] And I thought that was so genius. It’s like, oh, okay, well if the artist says so, fine; I’ll just sell these things. But I think, yeah, he wouldn’t have minded the preservation. But I mean, we understand that it’s flimsy. We understand that it was meant to, you know. And also like just to maybe the other comment is with the punk ethic that it was not meant to be made precious, it was not meant to be made collectible to a certain extent, it was not meant to be owned and contained and made palatable in any way. And even not meant to be remembered.\nJR: Well, that’s not __.\nVC: Which is a very strange thing to say but at the same time it was, I just remembered all three of the punk things, because we did pose in the end, but there was a lot of times when we were saying: no; we’re not.\nJR: Well, some things were meant to be ephemeral, of the moment. But then if you do have something, you don’t want it to further deteriorate. Then there’s also an aspect of like saying: Okay, Utrecht paint; you better buy a bunch now so you have a stock of it. Or like, the way you can tell a real or a fake Basquiat of a certain period is to go like, oh, the Xeroxes that he glued down at the time, Xerox had this sort of raised ink; you could feel the ink because it was actually plastic glued down to the paper, heated and glued into the paper. If it doesn’t have that kind of ink, it ain’t the real thing. __\nVC: Yeah, a lot of the time David would have been using clear varnish, you know, the clear paint medium, again.\nJR: Roplex or something?\nVC: No, no, no. He was still using just the glaze, the painting glaze, the plastic glazes, right? Matte Utrecht, that would have been the glue, not – you know, for the decoupage.\nJR: Utrecht was the closest store to him because he was up there at Peter’s thing, so it was like literally right around the corner __.\nGW: Yeah, that’s helpful.\nVC: Just to add to that, you know, my memory of the things that were being used.\nMT: Mm-hm.\nGW: Can you think of anyone else we should talk to? Who else is around that might have memories of working __[1:10:17]\nJR: The other person that actually, somebody else that collaborated with him was Steve Downton, and he’s on my Facebook. He did some work with David __.\nVC: Yes, Steve would be a good one.\nJR: I don’t know, where’s Rich Colicchio? He would know about that 51X thing. I don’t have any pictures of that.\nVC: You know, and I would say, you know who would know a lot about it? David West, actually.\nJR: David West __\nVC: David West collaborated with him and his\nJR: Christof Kohlhofer went to the same things that we did with David.\nVC: Yes, but David West painted with him a lot.\nJR: David painted with him.\nVC: David and, the two Davids again, more Davids,\nJR: Keiko, as well.\nVC: Were both showing with Gracie Mansion at a certain point. Um, and __\nJR: Keiko, Christof, David, you know, that was our crew of people that, we all painted with David. Luis is long dead.\nVC: Luis came and did, well, he wasn’t long dead. Luis came and did the installation at the back of the third Ground Zero on Ninth Street.\nJR: I think Bronson Eden. I mean, the people from.\nVC: Just to say, we had moved to Ninth Street between Second Avenue and Third Avenue. And we just had a downstairs gallery with a back yard, and we went out the back and painted the back yard. But David did a show there, but I don’t think he did so much in the back yard. But Luis did rats, we did like a thousand rats.\nJR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. David wouldn’t participate in that particular one. __\nVC: __ rats. Lovely.\nMT: I love rats.\nVC: I do, too. I have to send you a picture of __\nJR: Keiko Bonk is now in Hawaii; David West is in France. Marilyn [Minter?] is huge now.\nVC: Yes, of course. Well she was sort of the least interactive of that crowd.\nJR: Well, because she had her own thing and she had – well that was really a drag because she had to use the projector, so she turned off all the lights. I’m like: Damn, we’ve gotta sit in the dark while she does this thing.\nVC: And she smoked like – I mean, everybody was smoking, but she really smoked. She really, really smoked. Well thank you for allowing us to save this information.\nGW: Yes, thank you so much. This is really, really helpful.\nVC: Thank you for allowing us to save this information.\nJR: I don’t know if that makes sense at all what I said about the comics, but if you have any other questions, you can ask, because he did it. Because I scrambled that like eggs.\nEnd transcription at 1:12:31; audio continues to 1:17:24\nRetrieved from \"\nhttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/ArtistArchives/KnowledgeBase/index.php?title=Interview_Text_with_David_Kiehl_by_Diana_Kamin_and_Marvin_Taylor_on_8-10-2016&oldid=4304\n\"\nCategory\n:\nInterview Text\nThis page was last modified on 12 May 2017, at 09:27.\nContent is available under\nNew York University | Fales Library & Special Collections\nunless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nDisclaimers\nNavigation menu\nDavid Wojnarowicz\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nNavigation\nWelcome\nProject Website\nCredits\nAbout\nDavid Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base\nThe Database Challenge\nTechnical Summary\nHow To Use This Site\nHow to Contribute\nArtist Biography\nBiography\nPeople\nWorks\nWorks Overview\nCase Studies\nMediums\nExhibitions\nExhibition History\nVenues\nInstallations\nResources\nSelected Bibliography\nInterviews\nUnpublished Research\nExternal Resources\nCentral Image Gallery"}
