<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="A_Fire_In_My_Belly_in_the_Hide.2FSeek_exhibit">A Fire In My Belly in the Hide/Seek exhibit</span></h3>
<p>On October 30th, 2010, the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. opened the exhibition <i>Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture,</i> curated by <a href="Katz,_Jonathan_David.html" title="Katz, Jonathan David">Jonathan David Katz</a>. The exhibition featured a 4.16 minute film, credited as “A Fire In My Belly” by the artist David Wojnarowicz. However, Wojnarowicz never publicly displayed <i>A Fire In My Belly</i> in a finished form, and the version shown at the Smithsonian was created specifically for <i>Hide/Seek</i> by Katz and the artist <a href="Everly,_Bart.html" title="Everly, Bart">Bart Everly</a>, with permission from the Wojnarowicz estate. 
</p><p>This edit was created from footage found on a Super 8mm reel of film acquired by the Fales Library and Special Collections in 2000, which was labeled (by Wojnarowicz himself) “Mexico, etc... Peter, etc…For Michael Lupetin.” 
</p><p><i>Mexico, etc...</i> was created by Wojnarowicz and a collaborator (Marion Scemama) specifically for use in Rosa von Praunheim’s 1990 documentary <i>Silence=Death,</i> which was about artists and AIDS. <a href="Lupetin,_Michael.html" title="Lupetin, Michael">Michael Lupetin</a> was the producer on that project. 
</p><p>However, the footage on <i>Mexico, etc…</i> correlates closely to another reel of Super 8mm film and a shooting script also held in the Wojnarowicz Papers, both of which were labeled “A Fire In My Belly” by Wojnarowicz. According to a timeline written for the catalog of his 1990 show <i>Tongues of Flame,</i> Wojnarowicz considered <i>A Fire In My Belly</i> unfinished, writing that he “went through 2 versions then disassembled for other projects.”<sup id="cite_ref-Blinderman.2C_Barry.2C_.27.27David_Wojnarowicz:_Tongues_of_Flame.2C.27.27_exhibition_catalogue.2C_23_Jan-4_March_1990.2C_Illinois_State_University.2C_Normal.2C_Illinois._1-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-Blinderman.2C_Barry.2C_.27.27David_Wojnarowicz:_Tongues_of_Flame.2C.27.27_exhibition_catalogue.2C_23_Jan-4_March_1990.2C_Illinois_State_University.2C_Normal.2C_Illinois.-1">[1]</a></sup>   The version shown in <i>Hide/Seek</i> featured at least one frame from every individual shot in “Mexico, etc…” although not in the same order as they were presented in the original. 
</p><p>The film shown in <i>Hide/Seek</i> used an audio recording from the Wojnarowicz Papers at the Fales Library as a soundtrack, which was recorded at a 1989 ACT UP demonstration attended by Wojnarowicz. 
</p><p>In the National Portrait Gallery, this film was placed in a room dedicated to AIDS-related artwork. The film was installed on a touch screen, which required visitors to activate it specifically.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Curatorial_Intentions">Curatorial Intentions</span></h3>
<p>Jonathan David Katz stated that he wanted to show Wojnarowicz’s film work, but none of his films were under four minutes, the limit imposed by the National Portrait Gallery. However, he felt that there was precedent for re-editing the raw footage on <i>Mexico, etc…</i> since it had been used in <i>Silence=Death.</i> 
</p><p>Katz’s goal was to make a version of <i>A Fire In My Belly</i> that was explicitly about AIDS; however, he also believed that the original film, as created by Wojnarowicz, was about the AIDS crisis. He stated that “[<i>A Fire In My Belly</i>] is about AIDS, but its metaphorical relationship to AIDS is so fine that it doesn’t even get noticed.”<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eleven_Controversial_Seconds">Eleven Controversial Seconds</span></h3>
<p>The controversy over <i>A Fire In My Belly</i> centered around eleven seconds of footage of ants crawling over a crucifix, an image that Wojnarowicz had recorded in 1986 during a trip to Mexico. This begins at the two minute mark in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external text" href="http://www.barteverly.com/pages/film_fire.html">Bart Everly’s website</a>.
</p><p>Wojnarowicz frequently used ants in his work. During the filming session for this segment of <i>A Fire In My Belly,</i> he also recorded ants walking on a clock face, toy soldiers, coins, and other everyday objects. In a 1989 interview, he stated that 
</p>
<blockquote><i>Animals allow us to view certain things that we wouldn't allow ourselves to see in regard to human activity. In the Mexican photographs with the coins and the clock and the gun and the Christ figure and all that, I used the ants as a metaphor for society because the social structure of the ant world is parallel to ours.</i></blockquote>
<p>According to his biographer, Cynthia Carr, Wojnarowicz’s use of ants represented “humanity rushing along, heedless of what lies under its tiny feet, indifferent to the structures that surround it.”<sup id="cite_ref-Carr.2C_Cynthia._.27.27Fire_In_the_Belly:_The_Life_and_Times_of_David_Wojnarowicz..27.27_New_York:_Bloomsbury._2012_3-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-Carr.2C_Cynthia._.27.27Fire_In_the_Belly:_The_Life_and_Times_of_David_Wojnarowicz..27.27_New_York:_Bloomsbury._2012-3">[3]</a></sup>

</p><p>On November 29th, one month after <i>Hide/Seek</i> opened, the Christian News Service published an article by Penny Starr entitled <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external text" href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/smithsonian-christmas-season-exhibit-features-ant-covered-jesus-naked-brothers-kissing">“Smithsonian Christmas-Season Exhibit Features Ant-Covered Jesus, Naked Brothers Kissing, Genitalia, and Ellen DeGeneres Grabbing Her Breasts.”</a><sup id="cite_ref-Starr.2C_Penny._.282010.2C_November_29.29._Smithsonian_Christmas-Season_Exhibit_Features_Ant-Covered_Jesus.2C_Naked_Brothers_Kissing.2C_Genitalia.2C_and_Ellen_DeGeneres_Grabbing_Her_Breasts._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.cnsnews.com.2Fnews.2Farticle.2Fsmithsonian-christmas-season-exhibit-features-ant-covered-jesus-naked-brothers-kissing_4-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-Starr.2C_Penny._.282010.2C_November_29.29._Smithsonian_Christmas-Season_Exhibit_Features_Ant-Covered_Jesus.2C_Naked_Brothers_Kissing.2C_Genitalia.2C_and_Ellen_DeGeneres_Grabbing_Her_Breasts._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.cnsnews.com.2Fnews.2Farticle.2Fsmithsonian-christmas-season-exhibit-features-ant-covered-jesus-naked-brothers-kissing-4">[4]</a></sup>  The Christian News Service is a division of the Media Research Center, a conservative organization whose mission is to “prove—through sound scientific research—that liberal bias in the media does exist and undermines traditional American values.”<sup id="cite_ref-About_the_Media_Research_Center..E2.80.9D_.5BPress_Release.5D_Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Farchive.mrc.org.2Fabout.2Faboutwelcome.asp_5-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-About_the_Media_Research_Center..E2.80.9D_.5BPress_Release.5D_Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Farchive.mrc.org.2Fabout.2Faboutwelcome.asp-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>A photo of the film in the exhibition, taken by Starr, was included at the top of the article, with the caption “A crucifix in the video <i>A Fire in My Belly,</i> part of the ‘'Hide/Seek'’ exhibit at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery. The image shows Christ on the cross with ants crawling over his body and face.”
</p><p>The article went on to describe the piece and Wojnarowicz at length, saying:
</p>
<blockquote><i>“A Fire in My Belly” was created by David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992). The full-length version of this 1987 video, according to the description at the exhibit, is 30 minutes long. The version viewable in the National Portrait Gallery has been edited down to 4 minutes. The description says, “</i>A Fire in My Belly,<i> a compilation of footage largely shot in Mexico, weaves together numerous images of loss, pain, and death into a metaphor for the AIDS epidemic; it concludes in a picture of the world aflame.”</i>
<p><i>The description speaks of the video artist's "poetic, yet furious, condemnation of the way greed, religion, and selfishness conspire to label certain people as outside the scope of our caring." It also quotes Wojnarowicz, who died of AIDS, as saying, “When I was told I’d contracted the virus, it didn’t take long for me to realize that I’d contracted a diseased society as well.”</i>
</p><p><i>The four-minute version of the video shown in the exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery shows, among other images, ants crawling over the image of Jesus on a crucifix, two halves of a loaf of bread being sewn together, the bloody mouth of a man being sewn shut, a hand dropping coins, a man undressing, a man's genitals, a bowl of blood, and mummified humans.</i>
</p><p><i>A differently edited four-minute version of Wojnarowicz’s “A Fire in My Belly” <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external text" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fC3sUDtR7U">video posted on YouTube</a> shows images of ants crawling over the image of Jesus (as does the version exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery), but also shows a man masturbating (an image which is not included in the edited version exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery, which only shows a man's genitals.). The YouTube version also carries a soundtrack that is different from the version exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery.</i>
</p><p><i>Wojnarowicz’s collected papers and work are held by the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external text" href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/woj.html">Fales Library and Special Collections</a> in New York City. CNSNews.com contacted the library to verify the authenticity of the edited version of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external text" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fC3sUDtR7U">"A Fire in My Belly" video posted on YouTube</a>. Marvin J. Taylor, the director at the library, told CNSNews.com that the edited YouTube version of the video “is accurate in that it is part of Fire in My Belly. David [Wojnarowicz] had a cutting script for the film that includes these scenes, plus others. The score by Diamanda [on the YouTube version of the video] is not original.”</i>
</p><p><i>Brent Phillips, the media specialist and processing archivist at the Fales Library and Special Collections, said the library supplied the "moving image material" for the video to the National Portrait Gallery, but added that he has "not seen the 'edit' that is currently part of the exhibit." The soundtrack for the video in the exhibit "came from an audiocassette in the David Wojnarowicz Papers here at Fales" and "is of an ACT-UP demonstration from June 1989," said Phillips in an e-mail to CNSNews.com. "The sound was added for the exhibit, but as stated, we have not seen the combined edit."</i>
</p><p><i>National Portrait Gallery historian and exhibit co-curator David C. Ward told CNSNews.com in an e-mail that “A Fire in My Belly” reflects the “violent, disturbing and hallucinatory” aspects of the AIDS epidemic.</i>
</p><p><i>“Fire in My Belly is an example of political engagement in artistic form with the AIDS epidemic by an artist deeply concerned with the exploration of our response to that medical and societal calamity,” Ward said. “That it is violent, disturbing, and hallucinatory precisely replicates the impact of the disease itself on people and a society that could barely comprehend its magnitude.”</i>
</p><p><i>“The museum was careful to edit the video for a museum audience,” Ward said. “It is a 4-minute sample of a much longer work and the curators and the museum were aware of our responsibility in introducing a difficult piece of work about an important subject in a way that respects the individual sensibilities of our public.”</i>
</p><p><i>A portrait of the video’s creator David Wojnarowicz, buried up to his face, is also in the exhibit. The catalog description says of the image: “Here, on the brink of a premature death, Wojnarowicz is at once disappearing peacefully into the American landscape and being violently suffocated by it.”</i>
</p><p><i>The Smithsonian-published catalog also notes (p. 54) that “Wojnarowicz earned a reputation for public, and for many, an utterly cathartic, portrait of rage.” It then quotes a passage from Wojnarowicz’s 1991 book, Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration, in which the artist writes of daydreaming about shooting darts dipped in HIV-positive blood into the necks of politicians and expresses his enmity for “walking swastikas that wear religious garments.”</i>
</p>
<i>“… and I’m waking up more and more from daydreams of tipping Amazonian blowdarts in ‘infected blood’ and spitting them at the exposed necklines of certain politicians or government healthcare officials or those thinly disguised walking swastikas that wear religious garments over their murderous intentions,” the Smithsonian catalog (p. 54) quotes Wojnarowicz as writing.</i></blockquote>

<p>Within twenty-four hours, The Catholic League – a powerful, conservative pro-Catholic organization – issued a press release that described the film as showing “large ants eating away at Jesus on a crucifix.”<sup id="cite_ref-Donohue.2C_Bill._.282010.29._.E2.80.9CSmithsonian_Hosts_Anti-Christian_Exhibit.E2.80.9D_.5BPress_Release.5D._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.catholicleague.org.2Fsmithsonian-hosts-anti-christian-exhibit-2.2F_6-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-Donohue.2C_Bill._.282010.29._.E2.80.9CSmithsonian_Hosts_Anti-Christian_Exhibit.E2.80.9D_.5BPress_Release.5D._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.catholicleague.org.2Fsmithsonian-hosts-anti-christian-exhibit-2.2F-6">[6]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The press release acknowledged the scholarly understanding that the ants were not intended as a blasphemous image, stating: 
</p>
<blockquote><i>Like others who have attacked Christians before with their “art,” [David Ward, co-curator of Hide/Seek] says the ants crawling all over Jesus represent “the lack of attention to Christian teachings.” So the ants are actually giving Christians a wake-up call! How thoughtful.</i></blockquote>
<p>The press release ended by stating:
</p>
<blockquote><i>It does not matter that private sources funded this exhibition: the majority of the money afforded the Smithsonian Institution comes from the taxpayers. Accordingly, I am writing today to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees asking them to reconsider future funding.</i></blockquote>
<p>Numerous politicians (primarily Republicans), condemned the work, Wojnarowicz, the entire exhibit, and the Smithsonian as a whole, with phrases taken directly from The Catholic League and The Christian News Service. 
Georgia Representative Jack Kingston said on Fox News that:
</p>
<blockquote><i>If they’ve got money to squander like this – of a crucifix being eaten by ants, of Ellen DeGeneres grabbing her breasts, men in chains, naked brothers kissing – then I think we should look at their budget.</i></blockquote>
<p>As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he went on to advocate “calling them [the Smithsonian] up in front of the Appropriations Committee, asking for some resignations, auditing all their budget — all their books.”<sup id="cite_ref-.E2.80.9CSmithsonian_to_Remove_Ant-Covered_Jesus_on_Cross_Video_From_Exhibit..E2.80.9D_.282010.2C_November_30.29_FoxNews.com._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.foxnews.com.2Fus.2F2010.2F11.2F30.2Fsmithsonian-remove-ant-covered-jesus-cross-video-exhibit.html_7-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-.E2.80.9CSmithsonian_to_Remove_Ant-Covered_Jesus_on_Cross_Video_From_Exhibit..E2.80.9D_.282010.2C_November_30.29_FoxNews.com._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.foxnews.com.2Fus.2F2010.2F11.2F30.2Fsmithsonian-remove-ant-covered-jesus-cross-video-exhibit.html-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Shortly after the Catholic League issued their press release, House-Majority-Leader-Elect Eric Cantor issued a statement saying:
</p>
<blockquote><i>When a museum receives taxpayer money, the taxpayers have a right to expect that the museum will uphold common standards of decency. The museum should pull the exhibit and be prepared for serious questions come budget time.</i></blockquote>
<p>Cantor also called the film an “outrageous use of taxpayer money and an obvious attempt to offend Christians during the Christmas season."<sup id="cite_ref-ibid_8-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-ibid-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>Incoming House Speaker John Boener also weighed in, stating that:
</p>
<blockquote><i>American families have a right to expect better from recipients of taxpayer funds in a tough economy… Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves to end the job-killing spending spree in Washington.<sup id="cite_ref-ibid_8-1" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-ibid-8">[8]</a></sup></i></blockquote>
<p>By the end of the day, the Secretary of the Smithsonian, G. Wayne Clough, had pulled the film from the exhibition, without consulting the curators or the National Portrait Gallery.

Gallery">PPOW Gallery</a>, which represents the Wojnarowicz estate, made two versions of A Fire In My Belly viewable on its website: the entire seven-minute reel labeled “Mexico, etc…” that Katz had used as source material, and a thirteen-minute Super 8mm reel of related footage, also contained in the Wojnarowicz archive at the Fales Library and Special Collections, which Wojnarowicz himself had labeled “A Fire In My Belly.” They also made DVDs of these works available to any institution that wanted to show them.
</p><p>PPOW Gallery also issued an Official Statement on the controversy, which read:
</p>
<blockquote><i>PPOW and The Estate of David Wojnarowicz disagree with the Smithsonian's decision to withdraw the artist's 1987 film piece "A Fire in My Belly" from the National Portrait Gallery's exhibition entitled "Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture." PPOW has represented Wojnarowicz's work since 1988 and maintained a close working relationship with the artist until his death in 1992. The gallery now represents his estate.</i>
<p><i>On behalf of the estate, the gallery would like to offer the artist's words to illuminate his original intentions. In a 1989 interview Wojnarowicz spoke about the role of animals as symbolic imagery in his work, stating, "Animals allow us to view certain things that we wouldn't allow ourselves to see in regard to human activity. In the Mexican photographs with the coins and the clock and the gun and the Christ figure and all that, I used the ants as a metaphor for society because the social structure of the ant world is parallel to ours."</i>
</p><p><i>The call for the removal of "A Fire in My Belly" by Catholic League president William Donahue is based on his misinterpretation that this work was "hate speech pure and simple." This statement insults the legacy of Wojnarowicz, who dedicated his life to activism and the arts community. David Wojnarowicz's work is collected by international museums including the Museum of Modern Art, NY, The Whitney Museum, The Library of Congress, The New York Public Library, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Reina Sofia in Madrid, Museum Ludwig in Cologne, the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, etc. Wojnarowicz is also an established writer; his most well known memoirs are Close to the Knives and Memories That Smell Like Gasoline, which are included on many university syllabi.</i>
</p>
<i>In 1990 the artist won a historic Supreme Court case, David Wojnarowicz v. American Family Association. The courts sided with Wojnarowicz after he filed suit against Donald Wildmon and the American Family Association, who copied, distorted and disseminated the artist's images in a pamphlet to speak out against the NEA's funding of exhibits that included art works of Wojnarowicz and other artists. We are deeply troubled that the remarks, which led to the removal of David's work from Hide/Seek, so closely resemble those of the past. Wojnarowicz's fight for freedom of artistic expression, once supported by the highest court, is now challenged again. In his absence, we know that his community, his supporters, and the many who believe in his work will carry his convictions forward.<sup id="cite_ref-PPOW_Gallery._.282010.29_.E2.80.9CPPOW_and_Estate_statement.E2.80.9D_.5Bpress_release.5D._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.space538.org.2Fexhibitions.2Ffire-my-belly-1986-87-2010_9-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-PPOW_Gallery._.282010.29_.E2.80.9CPPOW_and_Estate_statement.E2.80.9D_.5Bpress_release.5D._Retrieved_from_http:.2F.2Fwww.space538.org.2Fexhibitions.2Ffire-my-belly-1986-87-2010-9">[9]</a></sup></i></blockquote>

<p>In a press release (since removed from their website), the Association of Art Museum Directors strongly rebuked the Smithsonian for their decision. In part, the statement read:
</p>
<blockquote><i>More disturbing than the Smithsonian’s decision to remove this work of art is the cause: unwarranted and uninformed censorship from politicians and other public figures, many of whom, by their own admission, have seen neither the exhibition as a whole or this specific work.</i>
The AAMD believes that freedom of expression is essential to the health and welfare of our communities and our nation. In this case, that takes the form of the rights and opportunities of art museums to present works of art that express different points of view.<sup id="cite_ref-Knight.2C_Christopher._.E2.80.9CArt_museum_directors_issue_stern_Smithsonian_rebuke.E2.80.9D_.5BLos_Angeles.5D_3_December_2010._Retrieved_from:_http:.2F.2Flatimesblogs.latimes.com.2Fculturemonster.2F2010.2F12.2Fart-museum-directors-issue-smithsonian-rebuke.html_12-0" class="reference"><a href="A_Fire_in_My_Belly_Controversy.html#cite_note-Knight.2C_Christopher._.E2.80.9CArt_museum_directors_issue_stern_Smithsonian_rebuke.E2.80.9D_.5BLos_Angeles.5D_3_December_2010._Retrieved_from:_http:.2F.2Flatimesblogs.latimes.com.2Fculturemonster.2F2010.2F12.2Fart-museum-directors-issue-smithsonian-rebuke.html-12">[12]</a></sup><i></blockquote></i>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="At_the_Fales_Library">At the Fales Library</span></h3>
<p>The proliferation of versions of <i>A Fire in My Belly</i> being shown publicly, along with inaccurate statements made about them in the media, prompted Marvin Taylor and Brent Phillips at the Fales Library and Special Collections to release a fact sheet about <i>A Fire In My Belly.</i> It stated:
</p>
<blockquote><i>In the rush of reporting on the National Portrait Gallery’s removal of David Wojnarowicz’s film A Fire in My Belly several inaccuracies have been reported and reprinted/posted.  Below are some corrections to those errors based on the primary source material held in the David Wojnarowicz Papers at Fales Library, New York University.</i>
<p><i>1. A Fire in My Belly was originally shot on Super8mm film and did not have a completed soundtrack. It is not a “video.”</i>
</p><p><i>2. A Fire in My Belly was never completed by Wojnarowicz. A text panel at the end of the film reads: “Film In Progress, David Wojnarowicz, 1986-7.”</i>
</p><p><i>3. The incomplete A Fire in My Belly runs 13 minutes. Had it been completed it would have run longer. We have a cutting script Wojnarowicz was working from, thus we know that there are sections not included in this segment.</i>
</p><p><i>4. A Fire in My Belly was not created as an homage to Peter Hujar. In fact, it is questionable if it was created as a response to AIDS. It predates Wojnarowicz’s finding out that he was HIV positive and the change in his work that reflects his status.</i>
</p><p><i>5. An additional section/chapter/excerpt from A Fire in My Belly was located on another film reel in Wojnarowicz’s collection. It runs 7 minutes. These sections are listed in the cutting script under the section heading “Prostitution.”. This section was used by Wojnarowicz and Rosa von Praunheim in von Praunheim’s film Silence = Death, 1989. We have a super8 film roll that Wojnarowicz titled that reads “Peter, etc…. Mexico, etc.” and contains the name “Michael Lupetin” written in pencil and has Wojnarowicz’s  phone number “228-7024 NYC”—all written in Wojnarowicz’s hand. Lupetin was the producer of Silence=Death. Based on the edge code, the film stock is dated 1986-7.</i>
</p><p><i>6. A 4-minute edit of this 7-minute excerpt was used in the Hide/Seek exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery with an added soundtrack derived from an audiocassette from Wojnarowicz’s Papers of a June 1989 ACT-UP demonstration. This added soundtrack was not part of the artist’s original work and/or vision and probably has led people to think that A Fire in My Belly was about the AIDS crisis. The addition of this soundtrack was approved by the Wojnarowicz estate.</i>
</p><p><i>7. The YouTube version of FIMB with music from Plague Mass by Diamanda Galas was loaded by Semiotext(e). This version originally appeared in Rosa von Praunheim’s film Silence = Death, 1989. The master footage for this version with the Galas soundtrack is not in the David Wojnarowicz Papers at the Fales Library nor is there any indication that Wojnarowicz created this version. It is debatable whether the piece included in von Praunhiem's film could be called A Fire in My Belly. The most we can accurately say is that the footage was removed by Wojnarowicz from A Fire in My Belly and given to Michael Lupetin for use in Silence=Death.</i>
</p>
<i>8. We do not know why Wojnarowicz never completed A Fire in My Belly.</i></blockquote>
