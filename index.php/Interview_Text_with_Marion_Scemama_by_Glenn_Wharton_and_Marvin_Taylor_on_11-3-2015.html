                    Interview with Marion Scemama by Glenn Wharton and Marvin Taylor on 11-3-2015
                </p>

                <p>GW: Today is November 3rd, 2015. I’m Glenn Wharton, here with Marvin Taylor, the Fales Special Collections, NYU. We are here with Marion Scemama to interview her about David Wojnarowicz.</p>
                <p>MT: Thank you, Glenn. Welcome, Marion. It’s lovely to have you here to talk about David Wojnarowicz and his work for the resource we’re trying to build about understanding David’s works. And so we thought we’d start today by asking you about the collaborations that you did with David and about how he worked and how you worked together with him.</p>
                <p>MS: Well, that’s a strong question. How can I start? I think the first collaborations were in photography, because I was a photographer and am still a photographer. So I think David also used me to take photos of ideas he had. Except the first one. The first collaboration we did was about a poster. In fact, the first photos we did we were at the pier. And I wanted to take photos of him for a French magazine. I was doing a story about the East Village. It was at the beginning of 1983. And we met for these photos in, I think, January, 1984. And I wanted to photograph him at Pier 34 where all of the artists’ work was. And he said, “No, no; I’m going to take you to another pier less known. It’s Pier 28. It’s a pier where I went there because there were too many people and it became fashionable to go to Pier 34.” So he took me to that pier, and that’s where there is the image of the pterodactyl. And I took photos in black and white and in color, and portraits of him near the work. And there was a beautiful head of a dog, and also a man with a bird face, and another one was the pterodactyl. So this was more like a journalistic work. And then he asked Civilian Warfare, Dean Savard. He said he was about to have a show and he said that he wanted me to take the photo for the poster. So Dean called me and I went to David’s house. It was on Fourth Street near the Bowery. It was a very small apartment. And when we got in the apartment, there was a kitchen and there were all these plaster heads in the kitchen, and that’s where we did portraits and I did two or three contact sheets on different. And then I had a darkroom at home, and so I printed the photos. He came to my place and we chose the photo for the poster together. This was really the first collaboration work. And I think the poster was a nice one.</p>
                <p>MT: I know it; it’s really beautiful. Those are wonderful photos of him, too. It’s the Forty Heads of State project. Yes. One question I’ve always had is, how did David learn to print photos? I don’t know the history of him printing.</p>
                <p>MS: I think, I guess he learned with Peter. I think so, because I had a darkroom at my place, but he never came to print. He came to my place to paint, because I had a big wall. So sometimes he would come with a canvas and paint; and me, I would be in the darkroom working. We liked that, you know, and we would stop for a coffee, and showing each other what we were doing. And also, you know, the trust between us, for me it started because I loved the pier. I discovered the pier in ’84 – no, it was in ’83. Summer 1983 I spent all of my summer at the pier, going there every day, looking at the sun, of course, to see where the light was coming, at what time, et cetera. And I took a lot of pictures, slides and black-and-white, and I was really, really in love with that place. So there was already a connection with David. And when we met for, after I did the poster, he came to my place and I showed him prints of the photos I took at the pier. And for me, you know, I always have been a journalist photographer, but I never considered myself like an artist, even if I had my own personal work, but it was more for me and my friends, right? And when he saw the photos, he said, “But Marion, you have to take yourself seriously. You are an artist. This is beautiful.” And for me it was like, somebody who said to me, “You’re an artist.” You know? I mean, I could just look at him and say, ‘Well, this guy is great to say that to me;’ you know? So there was a trust like that. And at that moment, I was friends with Catherine Texier and Joel Rose. We were pretty close friends. And they had this magazine Between C & D. And one day they said – they knew I was friends with David, and they said oh, we’d love to have a text from David and make him that he makes a cover for the magazine. And so I talked about that to David and he was really delighted by the idea. He met Joel and Catherine, and then he said, “Let’s make a poster together.” And he had this idea, he had the text. And he had the idea of the photo. So this is more like the way we worked together. I would support him and put my connections, you know, give him my connections and create relationships with people that could support him and help him. And he would, I would say, use me to help him to do what he had in mind. Because he was taking photos at that point, since a long, long time ago. But I think he, maybe because of Peter, he never trusted too much his photography. Maybe because of Peter’s look. You know, like Peter was really in fine art photography, and David was more like snapshots. But I guess he wasn’t afraid of me. He saw my photos; he saw that we could be at the same level; he could trust me. I’m sure that all of the work we did together, it was his concept. And I was there to realize this, to produce this concept with my camera or with discussion. Because we used to speak a lot. We used to speak a lot, and to exchange ideas. And I think this was more the kind of collaboration we had.</p>
                <p>GW: What other kind of work did you do together? There’s the poster and photographs.</p>
                <p>MS: We did a show at T. Greathouse Gallery. There was Greer Lankton in the show, that I was very close with her. And we would meet often with David at my apartment.</p>
                <p>GW: So this was an exhibition.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes, it was an exhibition. So there was Greer Lankton who showed photography, because the gallery was just about photography, and he was the only one in the East Village showing just photography. And David and me, we worked on paintings and photography. So in fact, what we would do is like, David would come to my place. He would have an idea of on Simonite, [? 9:25] do you say that? Like wood, you know? Like he wanted to paint this, or he would come with the painting and show me, and then I would have the idea of a photo I would insert. So he would cut the wood so I could insert the photo. So we worked out the size of the photo, if it would be black-and-white or color, and what would be the content of it. Like, for example, the one that is most published in catalogues is the one I did with him. It’s a painting of the city, I think, with a bridge. You have it in the catalogue. And there’s a photo; the photo I took, it’s a photo of Kiki Smith with a skull projected on her face. It’s a beautiful photo, very strong. And so her face is a skull, but her eyes that are really – it’s a black-and-white photo. And I said to David, you know, I would like – because I knew also the relationship between David and Kiki, and somewhere I wanted Kiki to be present also in this show. I was friends with Kiki, too. And she accepted that I take the photos and use this one. And when I showed the photo to David, he said, “Oh great, yes. We’re going to put it upside-down.” So it’s him who had the idea of putting it upside-down. I think it was a great idea. And then we did another painting with a photo I took in the street of a poster of Michael Roman, a guy screaming. And we did another one that he painted a tornado and a landscape, and then I put black-and-white photos of tigers in cages, you know like just getting bored. And I think yes, we did another one, but it was some, how do you call that? Not silk-screen but, you know, when you spray the painting.</p>
                <p>MT: Like stencil? [11:55]</p>
                <p>MS: Yes, stencils. And the background was covered with dead leaves, and it was red and black. And then I put the photo that we did under the bridge where he is like beat up. And I put a kind of a grillage in front of it. And this is one of the paintings, too. I have photos of that. I have photos.</p>
                <p>GW: Did you work on collages together? Or is that what you’re describing, where there’s paintings and</p>
                <p>MS: No, I’m describing that he would paint and I would bring a photo. And then we would see how this would fit in the painting, and he would cut out a window so I could put the photo behind. This was, I mean, we worked together because we spoke a lot, but at the same time, he would paint and I would say, “Okay, what do you think about this photo?” So this was the collaboration show we had.</p>
                <p>GW: What about films?</p>
                <p>MS: So film, again, it’s like I brought, I mean, he trusted me with video. The first time he asked me, he knew that I was making videos, because I was a photographer and I also liked to make videos, documentaries and sometimes like more personal videos. So the first time he asked me, he was doing this film with Rosa von Praunheim. And he called me in Paris and he said, “You know, I’d love you to be here in New York while I’m doing this film. I’m not very sure of myself, and you will help me to __[13:49] the film.” And he said, “Can you come with a video camera? So maybe we’ll do something together.” And so I rented a camera in Paris, and I came with a camera. And we talked – first it was my idea. I said, “We should maybe try to make a movie about you. Not a documentary, but something” – with David it’s never a documentary. It’s creative. So, he was excited by the idea, but at the same time he had mixed feelings about that, how he would represent himself at this stage of his life. He had just learned that he was HIV positive. So, you know, in fact, that’s what I say, it’s like, I could bring things to support his work. But in fact, almost everything we did was his idea. But you know like, for example, I say it in the book with Sylvère, in the interview. For example, the strongest example for me is that he shot, Rosa von Praunheim shot this – David wanted to have images of him kissing a man’s body. And I knew that he was attracted to Paul Smith, so I said, “You know, maybe you can imagine something with Paul Smith.” So he was excited by that, and he said, “But maybe Paul wouldn’t like it.” Also, I was close to Paul, we used to go on bicycles together and take photos around. And so I asked Paul and right away he said yes. So they started shooting for Rosa von Praunheim with a camera-person of Rosa, they started shooting something about David kissing a man. And then David took me to see the rushes. And in fact, we were kind of disappointed, because, I don’t know what went on because I’m not gay, but I don’t know if it was because the guy who shot it wasn’t gay or couldn’t understand really what could be between two men. I don’t know, but it was not really sensuous. It was more like wide angles, or, you know. And for me, maybe as a woman, I don’t know, or because I was close to David, for me, sensuality, it’s more like close-ups and follow, you know, a close-up on the mouth, a close-up on the bodies. So I imagined it differently. And so we were disappointed, and I said to David, “Let’s try to do it again, in your loft.” And we asked Paul if he wants to do it again. So Paul said okay. And we were there in the loft with Paul, David, and Andreas Sterzing. And we started shooting. So David knew what he wanted, but my eye kept the images. I filmed very in slow motion, like David kissing Paul’s body. And then they start – of course, the idea of Paul kissing David, and Andreas Sterzing putting water with strobe light; this is David images. </p>
                <p>MT: Absolutely; yeah.</p>
                <p>MS: So this was the kind of collaboration. And I say also, in the interview with Sylvère, it’s like that’s where I realized what could be my work in video with David. Like I was an extension of his eyes. Like, through my eyes, I was an extension of his mind somewhere. That I could make images the way – listening to him, I knew what kind of images I could do.</p>
                <p>GW: So this was When I Put My Hands on Your Body?</p>
                <p>MS: Yes.</p>
                <p>GW: And then there was Under Water.</p>
                <p>MS: Well, Under Water the same. If you read the interview with Sylvère, we went upstate New York. We rented a house, Sylvère’s house. I went there with my boyfriend, François __[18:45] and who edited all of the videos we did with David. And one morning, David was really depressed, and he had all of these horrible dreams, nightmares. And he talked for more than an hour about that all of this was meaningful, and all of this rage he had, confronting what he was going through. And I was desperate, because there was nothing I could do about it, just listen to him. And then I said to him, “Let’s go to the lake.” Because we used to go to the lake and film on the boat. And I said, “Let’s go to the lake and I can take images of you swimming, rowing, and then you can put a text on it. And it could serve the movie we want to do. It could help. Then I’ll make a clone so you can put a text on it, your voice over it, and speak about your tension and also that you feel like suffocating.” So we did that. We took the boat and we went on the lake, and I filmed him swimming, rowing. And then at a point, we had fun. I mean, if you listen to the sound, sometime we had fun. And I said to him, “Just go under the water to see what it does.” And then I saw these images of his face and his body completely distorted by the water. And then I said, “Look; this is great;” and I kept on doing these images. And he loved it, he really loved it. And so, you know, I helped him, like, I thought: Okay, I’m doing these images. They will help him to express something about his despair. And I did it, and, you know, he could make a piece; we could make a piece. But it would be his text. So that was the exchange we had. </p>
                <p>GW: Do you know much about how he worked with other people?</p>
                <p>MS: He loved to work with other people. No, I can’t say, because the only thing I saw is, you know that photograph that Andreas did of him, you know the portrait with the nest and the globe?</p>
                <p>GW: Yes; right.</p>
                <p>MS: Again, this was David’s concept. And Andreas technically did it very well, because it’s not a collage, it’s really on the same film. Like you would mask half of the negative to be able to have just one, and then he would do a mask on what he just shot, to shut something out. It was technically very well done. Not with other people, no, I don’t know. I wasn’t there.</p>
                <p>GW: I guess I’m just curious. The way you describe working with him, you said it was often very much his idea, and you worked with him to facilitate it but you obviously brought your own creative vision to it. Do you think he mainly worked like that with other people? Was it almost always his idea, or were there people that he would sort of allow other people to take the lead?</p>
                <p>MS: I can’t say. Really. I wasn’t there, so I can’t say. </p>
                <p>: Sure.</p>
                <p>MS: I mean for me, there was no power trip when we were working together. I was anyway, so en extase. You say that, you know, about David, and his work and his concept, and you know the way, the political way also of making art. So there was no power trip. I trusted him completely, and I think he trusted me a lot. We could exchange; it was really an exchange. Like, for example, when, that was the most exciting moment for me, when he prepared the first show at PPOW. I came three weeks before the show. He already sent me some photos. He was working in the darkroom, and he sent me some photos of the Sex series, like saying: You know, this is what I’m trying; I’m experimenting; what do you think about it? And I thought it was amazing, so I supported him. I said, “Great.” And then he said, “Why don’t you come? I need you. I have a lot of ideas.” So I came and I spent three weeks. And he had these ideas of photo pieces, so we went through the contact sheets, you know, like, looking what would match together and what he could say about a piece. Like, there was The Weight of the Earth. There was the things about through economics, with the three. There was the baby, his niece, like a little baby. And then a photo of a soldier in front of a bush. And there were these three photos of the hands with money, the sewed lips, and a newspaper with money. And I think the newspaper was something from Wall Street, all the values. So we worked on that. I remember that we tried a lot of prints. He did all these prints in the darkroom, and we would put them on the floor and see how things would work together. Then he would think about it and conceive the piece. And I remember for the mats, he would measure everything very precisely and he would ask a professional person to cut the mats. But usually you give the photos and they put the mats on the photos. No, he would make the mats be cut, and then he would put the photos. I don’t know why, but he wanted things like very, very precisely.</p>
                <p>GW: It sounds like he was very methodical. [25:40]</p>
                <p>MS: Yes.</p>
                <p>GW: Did he actually think things through in advance?</p>
                <p>MS: I’m sure he had, in advance. You can see, for example, the video I shot when we were in upstate New York, this little bird.</p>
                <p>MT: I love that moment. Yes.</p>
                <p>MS: I’m sure he thought already about this text. It’s improvisation but he had already the idea of the text. I’m sure of that.</p>
                <p>MT: That’s really important, because he stops at some moment, and then he starts it again, and that’s where you can see that yes, he had thought this – it looks like it’s totally improvisatory but it’s not. It’s really planned.</p>
                <p>MS: The same with the little house, you know, this little house where people are living. It’s a little house, a cardboard house in the garden. And he shot it. And I think it’s something that he really conceived. But for example, there’s no editing in this piece. He did it all from the beginning to the end, with the voiceover. And you can hear the tap of the – because you know with this camera, there was a lot of effects possible. So you could shoot frame by frame by just pushing the button, and you can hear the sound of the button. But at the same time, that same summer, I don’t know if you saw in the rushes when he spoke to the cat and told the story; this is improvisation, completely. There was a book like this about animals, an old book, and there was this ugly cat but very, like, we liked, this ugly cat that came on his lap. And then he took the book and he is looking at the tigers and the leopard, and he said, “You see, this is your mom and this is your dad, and this is your crazy uncle, the drunk one. And this one, oh, he’s in the psychiatric hospital upstate,” you know, something like that. This was really improvisation. It was not something that he set.</p>
                <p>GW: Sometimes he planned things out and maybe other times he didn’t but it’s improvised.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes. [27:50]</p>
                <p>GW: I’m always interested in the relationship between an idea in an artist’s mind and then what happens in the creative process to that idea, and the end result. And I think different artists work in very different ways.</p>
                <p>MS: You see, I can show you something because it’s a part of the project I have here. Of course, I’m not going to do it like if we did it, but let me show you a storyboard that he left me. Because upstate New York, Andreas Sterzing went for a few days and he had this SVHS camera. And we worked with it and we loved it. At the beginning, it was more like vacation shooting, like laughing and being in the garden and stuff like that. And then I asked Andreas if he could leave us the camera because we were excited by that. We thought that we could do a lot of things that summer. It was not the purpose of going for the summer, because he was working on Close to the Knives. That’s why he took all of his diaries with him and all, you know. So it was more for him to work on the book. But then with the camera, something happened; we were excited by that. And then my friend François was with us. He said to David, he said, because we would look at what we shot every night on the TV set. And some few things were really beautiful, like the shooting underwater, and even David filming me rowing, and the story with the cat. So François said to him, “But you know, you should make videos the way you make your paintings. It means that you have a background, from a painting, and in your paintings you have cut out where you put photos or drawings or, you know. So what you should do is, instead of putting still images, you could insert moving images.” And François is a really good editor and a great filmmaker, video filmmaker. So he said to David, “You know, you could work video like that, and make images, moving images and still images.” So David loved the idea, and he said, oh, we should try to do something. And he said, “I’m going to draw you a storyboard, and then you take it to Paris and you see what you can do with it. And if you can find money to produce it, and we’ll try to do something.” So he left this.</p>
                <p>GW: What is it?</p>
                <p>MS: It’s a storyboard; you can look at it. It’s a short text that David wrote on the project. Maybe if you want to read it.</p>
                <p>GW: I could read it. It’s a paragraph. It says, “Video 5 to 6 minutes. This video will be a visual opera with spoken words exploring birth and death. It will examine in images the structures of nature and society. The icons of society in the forms of sex, money, death, religion and time. Ants will be used as a metaphor for human civilization, because ants create wars, have slaves, have monarchy systems, etc. All this will be viewed through the eyes of someone who is a social outcast, someone outside the accepted structure of society, a man who is homosexual and who has AIDS. David Wojnarowicz, 1989.”</p>
                <p>MS: So this was the summer. And here you have like – so we spoke about that and we decided to start with two paintings, this one, Something from Sleep and another one, Fear of Evolution, I think. So, from here, he drew the painting. And then he put, “Here you will put black. And here, on the second image, this becomes red, and this guy sleeping will be the Super 8 I shot of Peter dead.”</p>
                <p>GW: So these are just real quick sketches of paintings that he planned to make.</p>
                <p>MS: Not paintings; videos. [32:50]</p>
                <p>GW: I’m sorry, videos; yes.</p>
                <p>MS: Videos, because, for example, this is a still, this is the painting, but then it becomes moving here, because this becomes Peter Hujar and it’s Super 8 shooting. So the painting, I mean the frame, the image, starts moving. And then the next is this, and then he said: We will put real ants __[33:15] because here it’s more like, you know, it’s a drawing. So here we will put this with ants. And here there’s four moons, so these are photos. So he said everything.</p>
                <p>MT: This is the rabid dog photo, right?</p>
                <p>MS: Uh, which one is dog photo? I think it’s the one of the </p>
                <p>MT: From Fever?</p>
                <p>MS: Yes.</p>
                <p>MT: Yes, exactly. Right, I love, that installation.</p>
                <p>\MS: I have these prints.</p>
                <p>MT: You do? That’s one of my favorite of all of his works. It just tears me apart. It’s beautiful.</p>
                <p>MS: I really love it.</p>
                <p>GW: These sketches are extraordinary, because they really do illustrate just how he worked.</p>
                <p>MS: And you know, some of the shooting, it’s things that I did like, for example, this is in video, when we did When I Put my Hands on Your Body. It’s not in the final cut but I have the rushes. This is David undressing Paul. Some of the images are David’s images, footage, and some others are mine. Like here is the Christ. So he left, so you see, he conceived it. So of course, maybe if we would have had time to do it together, it would have changed things. You always change things because you have a concept but then something doesn’t work, so you put another image or you,</p>
                <p>GW: But these sketches are really well thought out. He definitely</p>
                <p>MS: Yes, that’s why I say, he knew what he wanted, from the beginning to the end.</p>
                <p>GW: Fascinating.</p>
                <p>MS: He did an experiment. [34:48]</p>
                <p>MT: Here’s the Christ with the ants, which of course, was that footage – here again, we’re talking footage that he had that he reuses in different times, and it signifies differently in different contexts.</p>
                <p>MS: Like a sentence. You build up a sentence. He built up a vocabulary of images, and then with that, he would put them in different ways and it would be a new sentence. </p>
                <p>MT: Yes, exactly. Because he talks about</p>
                <p>MS: That’s what I loved in his work. And I like the fact that images are used and they’re reused always in another context; you know?</p>
                <p>: Yes. Absolutely. These are beautiful. How wonderful.</p>
                <p>MS: So what we want to do, and that’s for this, that I came here at Fales, because what we want to do with François is to show the process of David’s work.</p>
                <p>GW: This is your current project. Could you just very quickly describe your current project?</p>
                <p>MS: The current project is the one I told you about, about the interview. But this will be a little bit an interview, but I want to make it also like to be just one piece. And what we want to do is to enter in David’s mind, concept and creation. So what we will do is, we start with this, and then each frame on the video, on the film, we’ll take, for example, this one, and we’ll put what he said. For example, one after the other, here is the black, we will have the painting, and then we will have this black. And then we go to the next. But we will start always from the drawing, always from the sketch.</p>
                <p>GW: Just to back up,</p>
                <p>MS: We’re not going to make it like he did it. We’re going to show his process of work. That’s what I would like to do.</p>
                <p>GW: So you’re creating a film based on interviews, or based on an interview. Could you just say that again? You described it before we started this interview.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes; okay. So this is – I videotaped – this is also something that I suggest. Because David was always complaining that intellectuals didn’t care about his work, that he was not intellectual enough for certain people. He was always saying that people don’t care, and he’d be, because he didn’t have the intellectual background. He was an intellectual, of course, thinking things. And he was reading also, maybe not books but at least the ideas that were in the books. And I was a very close friend of Sylvère Lotringer’s since the 1970s, and he always supported me in New York and even in my relationship with David. And also he rented the house to us. You know? I mean, he was very supportive. And I said to him – and he spoke about semiotypes or something like that, and I said, “Would you like Sylvère to interview you?” So he was like, “Oh, he won’t give a shit about that.” And I said, “Okay, let’s try.” And I asked Sylvère, and Sylvère of course said yes, of course. And he loved David’s work. And Sylvère is always curious about the artist and creation. So we set that interview. And again, that’s the way I would support him, you know, like trying to put my connections together to get him what he would like. [38:25]</p>
                <p>GW: So your plan is to use the footage of that interview as a basis for a film that you’re now making.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes. The interview will be a guideline. Like I said, the title of the film will be “Self-Portrait in 23 Rounds” which is the title of a chapter of David’s book. And a chapter in David Wojnarowicz’s life, 1989 -1991. And so we’re going to take the structure of the 23 Rounds; in fact, it’s going to be 23 chapters, talking. So we won’t need to be in a chronological aspect of the interview. But we’ll create chapters, and in the chapters we will let David speak about his work, about a lot of things, his anxiousness, his confrontation with death, and what he had at this moment in mind. But we will have also chapters that will be about creation, about David’s work, a documentary about David at this moment of his life. But also because he created a lot during these years. For me, it was one of the most prolific – which is not true, because when I see everything he has done, you know. But at that moment I shared with him, it was so creative. So I’m going to do that. So this will be a part of it. [40:10]</p>
                <p>GW: Yeah, well, I can’t wait to see that film!</p>
                <p>MT: Yeah; it’s amazing.</p>
                <p>MS: So I don’t know if we’re going to be able to put it entirely in the interview, but it will be a piece by itself, which will be a four or five minute video.</p>
                <p>GW: The sketches are fantastic. People will be really interested in seeing them.</p>
                <p>MS: I think it’s a good way to get into David’s mind. The question you were asking about how creates, how he comes from an idea to the production of this idea, I think this will be a</p>
                <p>GW: These sketches really speak to that.</p>
                <p>MS: And it’s an ambitious project, you know. I mean, I’m looking for $30,000 to do that, and $30,000 is not that much. But we need good equipment and also to pay the rights for the images, because, I guess, they are David’s images, so I will have to see with Tom and through you. And also technically we need, because we’re going to need also a sound engineer.</p>
                <p>GW: Could we switch gears a little bit? I’d like to discuss exhibitions. Because part of this resource we’re building will be for curators in the future who may want to exhibit his work. And so I think it’s important for them to understand how David exhibited his own work and other people’s work. Could you talk a little bit about the process or maybe even what you know of his vision for allowing other people to see his work?</p>
                <p>MS: What do you mean?</p>
                <p>GW: Can you describe it a little bit better, Marvin? I’m trying to put myself in the seat of a curator who really is trying to understand how David would want his work to be exhibited, or how he even did exhibit it. [42:22]</p>
                <p>MS: I know that in his diary about his first show at PPOW, I saw a note about the show. But you can see that it’s not really what, for example, he took photos of me in a swamp, covered with mud. And in the notes he said that he wanted to use it and also use the abandoned car with the globe and with another photo, and he didn’t use them. But he wrote about it. Maybe looking more closely to his diaries of 1988 and 1989, you could find other notes. When I will be in Paris – I started already looking at every page, and it’s unbelievable. It’s really great stuff. And me, I’m looking more, of course I looked at in the ’77 in Paris, et cetera, but I looked more ’88, ’89, and until ’91. And I’m sure I’m, going to find things. But there’s already a page that I took a screen shot of it. I can show it to you. </p>
                <p>MT: One question I have is, were you involved in any of the installations that he did? The installation pieces?</p>
                <p>MS: The one in, do you know these photos I did? It’s an empty lot on the Lower East Side, and he has – it’s on my computer, on my first page of computer, but I can send you the photos. It’s an installation on the lower East Side, and you have the baby elephant, you have the mannequin on fire, you have skulls, and fire in a garbage can. And I have two photos – I mean, we kept two photos of that. One he’s waiting. You know, he has a machine gun. He’s waiting like that on top of a little hill. And the second one, he’s shouting, like jumping, the beginning of jumping and shouting, screaming. This, yes, we worked together on that. But on the other ones, no. I don’tremember.</p>
                <p>MT: One thing we’re thinking a lot about is how did he go about the installations, and how did he choose objects, how did he place them. Because no one’s really done much research on it. And we have slides of a lot of installations, but there’s no complete list, for instance, of the installations.</p>
                <p>MS: I think, you know, he worked the same that I shared with him. It’s like he had already the idea in mind. He knew what he wanted to say and had already the idea in mind.</p>
                <p>MT: I know I’ve seen drawings in the collection where he, especially in the phone logs, he would sit there and talk on the phone and draw. And I’ve seen a lot of installation plans that are worked on in the phone logs, which I found really fascinating.</p>
                <p>MS: That’s strange.</p>
                <p>MT: Yeah.</p>
                <p>MS: But you mean that he was talking to other people?</p>
                <p>MT: Mm-hm.</p>
                <p>MS: Saying what he would do?</p>
                <p>MT: Well, I don’t know if that’s what it was, or if he was just talking to other people but sitting there and drawing while he was talking to them. Because the phone logs are actually filled with drawings as well.</p>
                <p>MS: What do you mean? The phone logs are the tapes, right?</p>
                <p>MT: No, no. </p>
                <p>MS: What is phone log?</p>
                <p>MT: He kept, and in fact, I do it now because he did it. I keep a notebook with everybody who calls me. And what David</p>
                <p>MS: Oh, okay; this is a phone log.</p>
                <p>MT: Yes. David kept these.</p>
                <p>MS: Okay, I thought it was the tapes of the answering machine.</p>
                <p>MT: Those are interesting too, but he kept these logs of everybody who called him, and he wrote</p>
                <p>MS: And the calendar.</p>
                <p>MT: And the calendars.</p>
                <p>MS: Because he would write, I remember when I shot his table, the calendar, he would put on every day everything he had to do. Yes, that’s great; that’s great you have that.</p>
                <p>MT: He’s meticulous about documenting himself all the time. It’s really fascinating. And the phone log tapes are really amazing. There are also audio diaries where he taped diary entries.</p>
                <p>MS: Before I leave, I’d like to listen to some of them __.[47:00]</p>
                <p>GW: You know, getting back to my question, maybe I can articulate it a little bit better. I worry that in the future, people won’t understand the ethos of downtown New York in this period. It really was not a museum scene. It wasn’t even, it became, a gallery scene, but a lot of it was on the street, was in warehouses, on the piers.</p>
                <p>MS: The pier was the beginning, really, of this artist crowd.</p>
                <p>GW: Yes. So I worry that exhibitions in white-cube galleries and museums in the future won’t communicate what was going on. And I think the longer we are from that period time-wise, the more difficult it will be for people to understand it and try to convey it in exhibitions. I think that was the root of my question.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes. But you know, I mean, those photos, if they want to reset the installations, they have to do it the way it is. They can’t interpret it; no? I mean, they have to follow what is on the slides.</p>
                <p>GW: Well, of course, it’s always a curatorial question, how much authorship can a curator bring to an interpretation of an artist’s work.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes but not in an installation. I mean, a curator won’t paint things on a painting.</p>
                <p>GW: Right. [48:35]</p>
                <p>MS: He can choose the painting. He can put it in relation with something else. That’s his creative work. But he is not going to paint on the painting. And I think, I mean for me, an installation has to be the way it was. And you know you could ask PPOW because I think they want to show the installation that was done uptown to great collectors like rich people who asked David to make an installation in their apartment.</p>
                <p>GW: Well we will definitely interview people at PPOW. Can you think of anyone else that we should interview?</p>
                <p>MS: Lots of people. Lots of people.</p>
                <p>GW: Who comes to mind?</p>
                <p>MS: In terms of collaboration?</p>
                <p>GW: Yes, people that worked with him or that would know him and that would be able to tell us things about his working methods or his exhibitions.</p>
                <p>MS: I mean, the ones I know in films are Tommy Turner. I don’t like too much the film they did together. I don’t know, I didn’t like it. It’s not really David. I mean, it was, but, I don’t know. Anyway, but Tommy Turner for sure, he traveled with him and they made movies together. __[50:00] as movie makers. In terms of artists, I was thinking about, oh, I forgot his name. He traveled with him, too, and they collaborated on certain things.</p>
                <p>MT: James Romberger?</p>
                <p>MS: Well, James, of course.</p>
                <p>MT: James and Marguerite.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes. I was thinking about this artist; I took him and his work – well, the name will come.</p>
                <p>GW: Anyone in Paris that we might not think of or know about?</p>
                <p>MS: No, in Paris no. I know his lover, Jean-Pierre, but he wasn’t an artist at all. You might ask Kiki Smith if she still wants to speak about that.</p>
                <p>GW: And Jean-Pierre wouldn’t be so helpful for the kinds of questions we’re asking?</p>
                <p>MS: Maybe, because he posed – when you look at the contact sheets, he posed for Rimbaud. I think Rimbaud started in Paris.</p>
                <p>GW: Interesting.</p>
                <p>MT: With the photos David did of the Eiffel Tower, et cetera.</p>
                <p>MS: Yes. No, they started in Paris. And you know, there’s this French artist, and I’m sure that David got the idea from him, Ernest Pignon, at this moment in 1977. I know because I loved this work, I loved this guy. And he had this set of posters of Rimbaud in Paris, and he would put them in corners, and it was fantastic. And I’m sure David got the idea from that.</p>
                <p>GW: Can you think of anything else that we haven’t brought up?</p>
                <p>MS: I mean, Jean-Pierre might have some work also, early work of David. As a collaborator, well, some are not there any more. </p>
                <p>GW: Is there anything else that you think that people should know about David and his work and his – when people are thinking about exhibiting or interpreting his work in the future. [52:35]</p>
                <p>MS: I don’t know. That’s a hard question. Maybe I’ll think about it and I’ll send it by mail to you. What should they know? They should know that they should try not to betray David’s mind and feelings in terms of art and in terms of politics. David was a very political artist. You know, it’s like sometimes I think about this like that. It’s like, when you see Josef Beuys, what they show now in galleries, it’s all clean, it’s all the conceptual work. And all of the political years are completely erased. And you know, I wonder if one day it’s not going to happen the same thing with David.</p>
                <p>GW: This is getting to my question. That his work was his life, and became very political, and of course with AIDS activism, and</p>
                <p>MS: Even before.</p>
                <p>GW: Yes, it was always political.</p>
                <p>MS: The way he would view society and the United States, like x-rays. He was very political even before the AIDS crisis.</p>
                <p>GW: And I worry that will be lost in the white cube.</p>
                <p>MT: Yes.</p>
                <p>MS: What do you call “the white cube”?</p>
                <p>GW: Oh, just a museum with white walls, a very sterile environment.</p>
                <p>MS: Ah; okay.</p>
                <p>MT: There’s something I’ve been wanting to ask for quite a while, and I hope it doesn’t go over into interpretation. I want to really keep it to The Fire in My Belly. But because you’re working on 1989-1991, it strikes me that David was working on A Fire in My Belly because he was concerned about the individual in culture. And that was what the original film was going to be about. And what happened with his diagnosis is that he changed his mind about what Fire in My Belly was going to be. And that’s when he took out the sections that he took out that ended up in Silence=Death with Rosa. And his work shifted from that politics about the individual in society</p>
                <p>MS: You’re right.</p>
                <p>MT: To the politics of someone with AIDS in society.</p>
                <p>MS: And I think for me, that’s why the piece for Rosa is stronger. It’s something like, each time I see it, it’s very strong. The editing is strong, the content is strong.</p>
                <p>MT: He sort of knew that Fire in My Belly was not going anywhere at that point, it seems, and so that’s why he put his energies with the strongest parts of Fire in My Belly, which ended up in Silence=Death. That seems to me; a hunch, but.</p>
                <p>MS: Now, you know, about the music, I can’t be – now things are mixed up in my mind. It’s possible, knowing Rosa, and Rosa being German, I think maybe he put the music of Diamanda; maybe it’s him. But at the same time, with François, when we look at Fire in My Belly, the editing is so close to the music that – you know, François is an editor, and he knows, he can say: This has been done with the music. Now my question is, how come that this piece of music is not in David’s files? That’s my question. Because I saw, since you wrote this text on __’s [56:25] book, because I read it and I think it was really interesting to see the work you did, et cetera. I’m sure the editing is David; I’m convinced; I’m convinced. I know David; I know his way of editing; I know, you know, it’s him. Now the music, now I have a doubt. I have a doubt. It could be Rosa, this, because in Diamanda there is also this kind of German, you know.</p>
                <p>MT: Mm-hm; very, very much.</p>
                <p>MS: But David never complained about it; never. I know David, and he always complained about everything and everybody. And if it was Rosa who had edited Fire in My Belly, I don’t think he would have accepted it. This I’m sure of that. Because, you know, his work was his work. Now, maybe, you know, he gave everything silent, and then I mixed up and I thought there was music with it. This, I’m not sure, you know. I’m not sure of that. When I read your article, then I had a doubt. Maybe the music came after; this is possible. But David liked it, that’s for sure. Because David saw the tape; he saw the final cut of the film. And so I never heard him, like, saying, “He stole my work.” You know?</p>
                <p>MT: That’s really helpful.</p>
                <p>GW: Yes, I’m glad we got to that.</p>
                <p>MT: Yeah.</p>
                <p>GW: Can you think of anything else that you’d like to say?</p>
                <p>MS: If you want, we can stop here. But if I have ideas of something, then I will send it by mail to you.</p>
                <p>MT: Please. Yes. That would be wonderful.</p>
                <p>MS: Okay.</p>
                <p>MT: Thank you so much, Marion.</p>
                <p>GW: Thank you so much for your time.</p>
                <p>MS: You’re welcome.</p>
